The snippets returned contain the title, authors, and conference information, but no direct summary.\n    *   **Assessment:** This paper is relevant because agentic AI systems often process data streams.

This will allow for more detailed querying in the next steps.\nOnly one paper was expanded, likely because the others were already fully loaded or not found. I will try again without the question to load all the papers in the memory.\nI made a mistake and need the `question` argument. I will rephrase and try again using the original query.\nIt seems the papers are already expanded.\n\nAdditional Needs: none\n\n[Step 4 - PaperAnalyst]\nOkay, I will provide a consolidated summary of the 3 papers, assess their worthiness based on citations, impact, and novelty.\n\nHere's what I'll do:\n1.  Query the paper memory to get summaries of each paper.\n2.  Assess their worthiness based on...(truncated)"}], "messageId": "d8f102d19f5c4b3cb74fe49605df8a82"}}}}
