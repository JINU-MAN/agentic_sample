Here's my plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Query Candidates:** Based on the topic \"physical AI,\" I will generate several query variations to capture different aspects of the field.\n2.  **Search the Web:** I'll use `search_web_candidates_with_mcp` to search for relevant papers and articles.\n3.  **Evaluate Relevance:** I will review the search results, focusing on recency, source authority (e.g., journals, reputable tech news sites), and content that clearly relates to physical AI.\n4.  **Fetch Promising Pages:** If the search snippets are insufficient, I'll use `fetch_web_page_with_mcp` to get more context from the most promising results.\n5.  **Extract URLs:** I will extract and return a list of URLs of relevant papers and articles.\n\nHere are the query candidates I'll use:\n\n*   \"physical AI\" recent papers\n*   \"physical AI\" applications\n*   \"physical AI\" robotics\n*   \"embodied AI\" recent papers\n*   \"physical artificial intelligence\" review\n*   \"physical AI\" challenges and opportunities\nThe initial search results are not relevant. It seems the queries are too broad and return definitions of \"physical\" or unrelated Taylor Swift quizzes. I will refine the queries to be more specific, focusing on the intersection of AI, embodiment, and robotics, and explicitly requesting research papers or articles.\n\nRevised query candidates:\n\n*   \"physical AI\" AND robotics research papers\n*   \"embodied AI\" AND robotics research papers\n*   \"physical AI\" AND \"artificial intelligence\" AND applications\n*   \"embodied AI\" AND \"artificial intelligence\" AND applications\n*   \"physical AI\" review articles robotics\n*   \"embodied AI\" review articles robotics\nThe search results are still not providing relevant academic papers or articles. The queries are still too general. I will try a more focused approach using specific keywords related to research areas within physical AI and embodied AI, such as \"perception,\" \"manipulation,\" and \"interaction\". Also, I will add \"site:.edu\" to restrict the search to educational institutions.\n\nRevised query candidates:\n\n*   \"physical AI\" AND robotics AND perception site:.edu\n*   \"embodied AI\" AND robotics AND perception site:.edu\n*   \"physical AI\" AND robotics AND manipulation site:.edu\n*   \"embodied AI\" AND robotics AND manipulation site:.edu\n*   \"physical AI\" AND robotics AND interaction site:.edu\n*   \"embodied AI\" AND robotics AND interaction site:.edu\nThere are no results. It seems the combination of keywords and the site restriction is too narrow. I'll remove the site restriction but keep the focused keywords.\n\nRevised query candidates:\n\n*   \"physical AI\" AND robotics AND perception\n*   \"embodied AI\" AND robotics AND perception\n*   \"physical AI\" AND robotics AND manipulation\n*   \"embodied AI\" AND robotics AND manipulation\n*   \"physical AI\" AND robotics AND interaction\n*   \"embodied AI\" AND robotics AND interaction\n*   \"physical AI\" survey paper\n*   \"embodied AI\" survey paper\nThe results are still not great, mostly leading to definitions or unrelated content. However, \"embodied AI survey paper\" shows some potential. Let me try a more direct approach, looking for specific review papers on \"embodied AI\". I will also search for \"physical AI roadmap\".\n\nRevised query candidates:\n\n*   \"embodied AI\" review paper\n*   \"physical AI\" roadmap\n*    \"embodied AI\" challenges\n*   \"physical AI\" challenges\nStill no directly relevant results. I suspect that \"physical AI\" is not yet a widely established term in academic literature, and \"embodied AI\" is dominated by discussions of conversational AI, rather than robotics. The results for \"embodied AI challenges\" are all about human health in hot weather.\n\nGiven the lack of direct results, I will try one last set of queries, focusing on related concepts and broader terms, and specifically looking for review papers.\n\nRevised query candidates:\n\n*   \"AI robotics\" review paper\n*   \"robotics perception\" review\n*   \"robotics manipulation\" review\n*   \"robotics interaction\" review\n*   \"AI robotics\" challenges\n*   \"robotics\" future trends\nThese results are still primarily news articles about robotics and AI, rather than review papers or surveys. It appears that finding a comprehensive review paper directly addressing \"physical AI\" or \"embodied AI\" in the context of robotics is challenging. I will return the most promising results from these broader searches, as a starting point.\n\nHere are the most potentially relevant URLs:\n\n*   [https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/robotics/](https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/robotics/) - IEEE Spectrum's robotics topic page provides news and articles on the latest developments in robotics. This could be a good source for identifying current trends and challenges.\n*   [https://news.mit.edu/topic/robotics](https://news.mit.edu/topic/robotics) - MIT News on Robotics.\n*   [https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2](https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2) - MIT News on AI.\n\n```\nAdditional Needs:\n- [PaperAnalyst] Find academic papers that discuss challenges and future directions in the intersection of robotics and artificial intelligence, particularly concerning physical embodiment and interaction with the real world.\n```"}}
