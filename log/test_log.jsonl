The current best practice would be to check if\\neach data includes any suspicious signatures, or simply strings,\\nwhich were obtained a priori by elaborate manual analysis\\nin previous cyberattack cases. Unfortunately, unknown at-\\ntacks, called zero-day attacks, cannot be timely detected in\\nthis way because no signature is available yet. To tackle this\\nproblem, recent studies have presented high-speed methods\\nthat can extract frequent substrings from the data stream and\\nuse them as attack signatures because the frequently-occurred\\nsignatures are often related with attacks; unfortunately, more\\nbenign signatures are extracted than malicious ones, espe-\\ncially when there is no attack in most of the time. This causes\\nboth a tremendous number of false-positives and extra human\\ninterventions to remove benign signatures. In this paper, we\\ndesign a new streaming algorithm that can ﬁrst identify a\\nfrequent group of signatures appearing together at the same\\ntime from data streams. Using this frequent signature-group\\ninstead of frequently-occurred individual signatures, the new\\nscheme achieves a high detection accuracy by mitigating the\\nfalse-positive problem with only a small ﬁxed amount of\\nmemory and a constant number of hash operations, which has\\nnot been achieved by any previous work. This improvement\\ncomes from a new method for summarizing similar data with\\na ﬁxed amount of memory, called a minHashed virtual vector,\\nwhich allows us to automatically identify a frequent group\\nof signatures with each data read only once. We perform ex-\\nhaustive experiments on different private and open datasets,\\nto verify both the practical effectiveness and the experimental\\nreproducibility of the new scheme.\\n1 Introduction\\nOne of the most important tasks in cybersecurity is to collect\\nand analyze data that come from a range of security products,\\nnetworking components, servers, and even user endpoints.\\nThe data can be security events or alerts triggered by moni-\\ntoring devices, network packets, emails, suspicious ﬁles, etc.,\\nwhich are continuously generated. These data are often col-\\nlected by a security operations center (SOC) where security\\nanalysts work for real-time monitoring and manual analysis\\nfor critical data [ 10, 25, 30, 56]. Recent studies reveal that\\nsecurity alerts overwhelm human resources by their large vol-\\numes [10, 16, 25, 30, 45, 56]. For example, more than million\\nalerts are generated per day while only dozens of people work\\nfor alert analysis at best. Therefore, intelligent and automatic\\ndata analysis tools are essential for this industry.\\nAttack detection still relies on signature matching after a\\nsignature, a simple string or a regular expression, is manually\\nwritten by experts. The problem is that attackers use more\\nzero-day attacks, vulnerabilities and exploits only known to at-\\ntackers [61], and the signature-based detection may not effec-\\ntively mitigate the attacks any longer. This motivates a lot of\\nmachine learning (ML) approaches for anomaly detection in\\ncybersecurity. However, ML inherently causes false-positives,\\nnon-attacks mistakenly considered as attacks [ 50]. As the\\nsheer volume of security data meets ML-based detection, a\\ntremendous number of false-positives may be generated. We\\nneed a new detection and prevention method that has both\\nthe advantages of the precise detection of signature-based\\nmethods and the zero-day attack detection of ML-based meth-\\nods. This motivates us to study a new automatic signature-\\ngeneration method to mitigate zero-day attacks.\\nExisting Solutions. The best practices of cyberattack de-\\ntection and prevention can be categorized into two types,\\nmisuse-detection and anomaly-detection [ 50]; in general,\\nmisuse-detection uses known signatures representing spe-\\nciﬁc attacks while anomaly-detection relies on machine learn-\\ning (ML). Therefore, misuse-detection is generally known\\nto be unable to detect a zero-day attack. Although anomaly-\\ndetection is known to mitigate zero-day attacks promptly\\nwithout human intervention, the false detection problem, also\\nknown as false-positive and alert fatigue, still seems chal-\\nlenging [10, 25, 50, 56]. Besides, because ML models hardly\\nprovide enough explanation or evidence about their decision,\\nUSENIX Association 32nd USENIX Security Symposium    4319 security operators are often reluctant to trust and deploy them\\nin production settings [ 17]. We summarize the different types\\nof intrusion detection and prevention schemes in Table 1;\\n• Manual rule composition : Detection rules, or signa-\\ntures, are manually composed by security experts after\\nnew attacks are analyzed with enough time and human\\nefforts [43, 49, 53]. This is practically adopted by most\\nsecurity products. Because signatures are speciﬁcally de-\\nﬁned, detection evidence is also provided. However, this\\nis not appropriate for detecting zero-day attacks because\\nno signatures are known yet.\\n• Signature generation: Signatures are automatically gen-\\nerated to detect a certain type of zero-day attacks that\\nare accompanied with a large number of similar data in a\\nshort period of time [ 9,39,48]. Such attacks may include\\nworms, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, etc.\\nThis automatic generation is useful, but existing methods\\nﬁnd only the most frequently-occurred substrings from\\na dataset. This causes a large number of false-positives\\nand requires additional human resources.\\n• Supervised learning: When a dataset includes both at-\\ntack and normal cases with labels, an ML model can\\nbe trained in a supervised way [ 19, 52]. The model\\ncan detect not only the attacks seen during the train-\\ning phase but also their variants [ 51]. Because attack\\nvariants can evade signature-based detection, supervised\\nlearning helps to detect simple zero-day attacks to some\\ndegree. However, data labeling requires extra costs and\\nhuman resources.\\n• Unsupervised learning: Even when there are no labels\\nfor the dataset, an ML model can be trained in an un-\\nsupervised way [54, 62]. In general, the training dataset\\nincludes only normal cases without attacks. Then, the\\nmodel can identify data somewhat similar to something\\npreviously seen. For a given test data, if the model con-\\ncludes that the data was not seen a priori, it can be consid-\\nered as a new data and potentially a zero-day attack [ 61].\\nThis inherently raises false-positives [ 50] and requires\\nextra efforts to reﬁne the training dataset where no attack\\nshould be included.\\nIn this paper, we present a new detection and prevention\\nmethod to mitigate a certain type of zero-day attacks that\\ninclude similar data redundantly. The new scheme can identify\\na group of similar data from a large volume of data streams\\nand automatically extract a group of signatures appearing\\nat the same time over the identiﬁed group. The signature-\\ngroup, instead of single signature, signiﬁcantly reduces false-\\npositives.

These data are often col-\nlected by a security operations center (SOC) where security\nanalysts work for real-time monitoring and manual analysis\nfor critical data [ 10, 25, 30, 56]. Recent studies reveal that\nsecurity alerts overwhelm human resources by their large vol-\numes [10, 16, 25, 30, 45, 56]. For example, more than million\nalerts are generated per day while only dozens of people work\nfor alert analysis at best. Therefore, intelligent and automatic\ndata analysis tools are essential for this industry.\nAttack detection still relies on signature matching after a\nsignature, a simple string or a regular expression, is manually\nwritten by experts. The problem is that attackers use more\nzero-day attacks, vulnerabilities and exploits only known to at-\ntackers [61], and the signature-based detection may not effec-\ntively mitigate the attacks any longer. This motivates a lot of\nmachine learning (ML) approaches for anomaly detection in\ncybersecurity. However, ML inherently causes false-positives,\nnon-attacks mistakenly considered as attacks [ 50]. As the\nsheer volume of security data meets ML-based detection, a\ntremendous number of false-positives may be generated. We\nneed a new detection and prevention method that has both\nthe advantages of the precise detection of signature-based\nmethods and the zero-day attack detection of ML-based meth-\nods. This motivates us to study a new automatic signature-\ngeneration method to mitigate zero-day attacks.\nExisting Solutions. The best practices of cyberattack de-\ntection and prevention can be categorized into two types,\nmisuse-detection and anomaly-detection [ 50]; in general,\nmisuse-detection uses known signatures representing spe-\nciﬁc attacks while anomaly-detection relies on machine learn-\ning (ML). Therefore, misuse-detection is generally known\nto be unable to detect a zero-day attack. Although anomaly-\ndetection is known to mitigate zero-day attacks promptly\nwithout human intervention, the false detection problem, also\nknown as false-positive and alert fatigue, still seems chal-\nlenging [10, 25, 50, 56]. Besides, because ML models hardly\nprovide enough explanation or evidence about their decision,\nUSENIX Association 32nd USENIX Security Symposium    4319 security operators are often reluctant to trust and deploy them\nin production settings [ 17]. We summarize the different types\nof intrusion detection and prevention schemes in Table 1;\n• Manual rule composition : Detection rules, or signa-\ntures, are manually composed by security experts after\nnew attacks are analyzed with enough time and human\nefforts [43, 49, 53]. This is practically adopted by most\nsecurity products. Because signatures are speciﬁcally de-\nﬁned, detection evidence is also provided. However, this\nis not appropriate for detecting zero-day attacks because\nno signatures are known yet.\n• Signature generation: Signatures are automatically gen-\nerated to detect a certain type of zero-day attacks that\nare accompanied with a large number of similar data in a\nshort period of time [ 9,39,48]. Such attacks may include\nworms, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, etc.\nThis automatic generation is useful, but existing methods\nﬁnd only the most frequently-occurred substrings from\na dataset. This causes a large number of false-positives\nand requires additional human resources.\n• Supervised learning: When a dataset includes both at-\ntack and normal cases with labels, an ML model can\nbe trained in a supervised way [ 19, 52]. The model\ncan detect not only the attacks seen during the train-\ning phase but also their variants [ 51]. Because attack\nvariants can evade signature-based detection, supervised\nlearning helps to detect simple zero-day attacks to some\ndegree. However, data labeling requires extra costs and\nhuman resources.\n• Unsupervised learning: Even when there are no labels\nfor the dataset, an ML model can be trained in an un-\nsupervised way [54, 62]. In general, the training dataset\nincludes only normal cases without attacks. Then, the\nmodel can identify data somewhat similar to something\npreviously seen. For a given test data, if the model con-\ncludes that the data was not seen a priori, it can be consid-\nered as a new data and potentially a zero-day attack [ 61].\nThis inherently raises false-positives [ 50] and requires\nextra efforts to reﬁne the training dataset where no attack\nshould be included.\nIn this paper, we present a new detection and prevention\nmethod to mitigate a certain type of zero-day attacks that\ninclude similar data redundantly. The new scheme can identify\na group of similar data from a large volume of data streams\nand automatically extract a group of signatures appearing\nat the same time over the identiﬁed group. The signature-\ngroup, instead of single signature, signiﬁcantly reduces false-\npositives. Because both the identiﬁcation of similar data group\nand the generation of signature group are automatically done\nwithout human intervention over data streams, we call the\nnew scheme Generative Intrusion detection and Prevention\nTable 1: Different Types of Intrusion Detection and Prevention\nType Accuracy Automation Zero-day\nMisuse-\ndetection\n(signature)\nManual rule\ncomposition [49, 53] High Low Low\nSignature generation\n...(truncated)"}}, "isError": false}}}

These intelligent agents, ca-\npable of reasoning, planning, delegating, and executing complex workflows,\nnow form the backbone of applications ranging from supply chain coordi-\nnation to personalized financial assistance. As the scale and complexity of\nmulti-agent ecosystems increase, so too do the requirements for secure, in-\nteroperable communication protocols.\nCommunication between autonomous agents introduces unique security\nchallenges. Unlike traditional client-server architectures, agent-based sys-\ntems must manage peer-to-peer trust, dynamic task delegation, and sensi-\ntive data sharing across heterogeneous actors. In such environments, the risk\nof credential leakage, overprivileged access, prompt injection, and unverified\nexecution grows exponentially [2, 3]. Standard security frameworks such as\nOAuth 2.0 and TLS, while foundational, do not provide sufficient granular-\nity or contextual awareness for these interactions, especially in cases where\nagents dynamically compose tasks involving payments, identity verification,\nor confidential documents [4, 5].\nTo address these gaps, several agent communication protocols have been\ndeveloped, each offering a different perspective on interoperability, trust man-\nagement, and delegation control [6]. Google’sAgent-to-Agent (A2A)protocol\n[7] introduces a declarative model for service discovery. TheAgent Commu-\nnication Protocol (ACP)[8] embraces flexibility with a registry-based model.\nTheCORAL[9] framework, in contrast, proposes a hybrid architecture inte-\ngrating on-chain smart contracts for payments with off-chain communication.\n•Google’sAgent-to-Agent (A2A)protocol [7] introduces a declarative\nmodel for service discovery.\n•TheAgent Communication Protocol (ACP)[8] embraces flexibility with\na registry-based model.\n•TheCORAL[9] framework, in contrast, proposes a hybrid architec-\nture integrating on-chain smart contracts for payments with off-chain\ncommunication.\nWhile these protocols present promising architectures, their security prop-\nerties are discussed in the literature but rarely subjected to comparative\nempirical testing [2]. This study fills this gap by providing a detailed, multi-\ndimensional security analysis and empirical testing. We establish a 14-point\n2 vulnerability taxonomy (Section 6), derived from literature and threat mod-\neling.\nOur findings reveal a critical ”architecture versus implementation” di-\nchotomy. We demonstrate that CORAL, while possessing a robust architec-\nture for integrating payments and securing data integrity via transport-layer\nvalidation, is critically vulnerable in its current public implementation due\nto fundamental authentication and authorization failures at its SSE gateway.\nConversely, our tests confirm that ACP’s architectural flexibility is, in itself,\na vulnerability, leading to predictable integrity failures and data exfiltra-\ntion in non-strict configurations. Ultimately, this paper contributes both a\ncomprehensive security taxonomy and the first empirical benchmark of these\ncompeting protocols. We conclude (Section 11) not by recommending one\nprotocol, but by proposing a hybrid model that synthesizes CORAL’s ar-\nchitectural strengths with the mandatory, granular integrity checks of ACP,\noffering a concrete path forward for resilient, AI-native communications.\n2 Background\nMulti-agent systems (MAS) leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) are increas-\ningly adopted in domains requiring distributed decision-making, automated\ncoordination, and collaborative reasoning. In such environments, autonomous\nagents often represent distinct stakeholders or functional modules, exchang-\ning structured messages through predefined interaction protocols. Repre-\nsentative use cases include autonomous orchestration, financial transaction\nsystems, healthcare diagnostics, supply chain optimization, and cybersecu-\nrity defense.\nA robust communication protocol in these contexts must ensure more\nthan reliable message delivery, it must preserve semantic integrity, context\ncontinuity, role negotiation, and, critically, security guarantees. Since AI\nagents frequently process or act upon sensitive data, vulnerabilities in their\ncommunication layers can compromise entire workflows. Therefore, secure\nagent protocols must provide protection against adversarial entities, unin-\ntended leakage, manipulation, and systemic compromise.\nBelow we summarize the principal categories of threats relevant to com-\nmunication among AI-driven agents. These categories synthesize findings\nfrom distributed systems, adversarial AI research, and classical network se-\ncurity.\n•Prompt Injection:An adversary may inject malicious instructions\ninto prompts or message payloads, coercing agents to disclose confiden-\n3 tial data or alter intended behavior. This class of attacks is extensively\ndiscussed in recent studies [10, 3].\n•Data Leakage / Exfiltration:Agents may inadvertently reveal pri-\nvate or proprietary content during multi-turn exchanges, especially\nwhen sensitive context persists across dialogue rounds [11].\n•Data Poisoning:Malicious actors can inject corrupted training or\ncontextual data, influencing downstream models to behave incorrectly\nor embed hidden triggers. Data poisoning has been empirically shown\nto scale across distributed and shared-context environments [12].\n•Adversarial / Malicious Agents:A compromised or impersonated\nagent may introduce false commands, disrupt negotiation, or propagate\nmalicious payloads across the system.\n•Replay Attacks:Attackers may capture, delay, or replay previously\nvalid messages, leading to repeated actions, synchronization errors, or\nunintended state transitions.\n•Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):Intercepting or modifying agent com-\nmunication allows attackers to compromise message integrity or confi-\ndentiality, particularly in non-aut...(truncated)"}}, "isError": false}}}

This \nreview critically distinguishes between AI Agents and Agentic AI, offering a structured, conceptual taxonomy, \napplication mapping, and analysis of opportunities and challenges to clarify their divergent design philosophies \nand capabilities. We begin by outlining the search strategy and foundational definitions, characterizing AI \nAgents as modular systems driven and enabled by LLMs and LIMs for task-specific automation. Generative \nAI is positioned as a precursor providing the foundation, with AI agents advancing through tool integration, \nprompt engineering, and reasoning enhancements. We then characterize Agentic AI systems, which, in contrast \nto AI Agents, represent a paradigm shift marked by multi-agent collaboration, dynamic task decomposition, \npersistent memory, and coordinated autonomy. Through a chronological evaluation of architectural evolution, \noperational mechanisms, interaction styles, and autonomy levels, we present a comparative analysis across \nboth AI agents and agentic AI paradigms. Application domains enabled by AI Agents such as customer \nsupport, scheduling, and data summarization are then contrasted with Agentic AI deployments in research \nautomation, robotic coordination, and medical decision support. We further examine unique challenges in \neach paradigm including hallucination, brittleness, emergent behavior, and coordination failure, and propose \ntargeted solutions such as ReAct loops, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), automation coordination layers, \nand causal modeling. This work aims to provide a roadmap for developing robust, scalable, and explainable \nAI-driven systems.\n1. Introduction\nPrior to the widespread adoption of AI Agents and Agentic AI \n(Fig.  1) around 2022 (Before ChatGPT was introduced), the devel-\nopment of autonomous and intelligent agents was deeply rooted in \nfoundational paradigms of artificial intelligence, particularly multi-\nagent systems (MAS) and expert systems, which emphasized social \naction and distributed intelligence [1,2]. Notably, Castelfranchi [3] \nlaid the critical groundwork by introducing ontological categories for \nsocial action, structure, and mind, arguing that sociality emerges from \nindividual agents’ actions and cognitive processes in a shared environ-\nment, with concepts like goal delegation and adoption forming the basis \nfor cooperation and organizational behavior. Similarly, Ferber [4] pro-\nvided a comprehensive framework for MAS, defining agents as entities \nwith autonomy, perception, and communication capabilities, and high-\nlighting their applications in distributed problem-solving, collaborative \nrobotics, and synthetic world simulations.\n∗ Corresponding authors.\nE-mail addresses: rs2672@cornell.edu (R. Sapkota), mk2684@cornell.edu (M. Karkee).\nThese early studies established that individual social actions and \ncognitive architectures are fundamental to modeling collective phe-\nnomena, setting the stage for modern AI Agents. This paper builds on \nthese foundational concepts to explore how social action modeling, as \nproposed in [3,4], informs the design of AI Agents capable of complex, \nsocially intelligent interactions in dynamic environments.\nClassical Agent-like systems were designed to perform specific tasks \nwith predefined rules, which offered limited autonomy, and minimal \nadaptability to dynamic environments. These systems were primar-\nily reactive or deliberative, relying on symbolic reasoning, rule-based \nlogic, or scripted behaviors rather than the learning-driven, context-\naware capabilities of modern AI Agents [5,6]. For instance, expert \nsystems used knowledge bases and inference engines to emulate human \ndecision-making in domains like medical diagnosis (e.g., MYCIN [7]). \nOther notable examples include DENDRAL [8], an expert system for \nmolecular structure prediction; XCON [9], used for computer system \nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.inffus.2025.103599\nReceived 29 May 2025; Received in revised form 25 July 2025; Accepted 30 July 2025\nInformation Fusion 126 (2026) 103599 \nAvailable online 22 August 2025 \n1566-2535/© 2025 The Authors.

This \nreview critically distinguishes between AI Agents and Agentic AI, offering a structured, conceptual taxonomy, \napplication mapping, and analysis of opportunities and challenges to clarify their divergent design philosophies \nand capabilities. We begin by outlining the search strategy and foundational definitions, characterizing AI \nAgents as modular systems driven and enabled by LLMs and LIMs for task-specific automation. Generative \nAI is positioned as a precursor providing the foundation, with AI agents advancing through tool integration, \nprompt engineering, and reasoning enhancements. We then characterize Agentic AI systems, which, in contrast \nto AI Agents, represent a paradigm shift marked by multi-agent collaboration, dynamic task decomposition, \npersistent memory, and coordinated autonomy. Through a chronological evaluation of architectural evolution, \noperational mechanisms, interaction styles, and autonomy levels, we present a comparative analysis across \nboth AI agents and agentic AI paradigms. Application domains enabled by AI Agents such as customer \nsupport, scheduling, and data summarization are then contrasted with Agentic AI deployments in research \nautomation, robotic coordination, and medical decision support. We further examine unique challenges in \neach paradigm including hallucination, brittleness, emergent behavior, and coordination failure, and propose \ntargeted solutions such as ReAct loops, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), automation coordination layers, \nand causal modeling. This work aims to provide a roadmap for developing robust, scalable, and explainable \nAI-driven systems.\n1. Introduction\nPrior to the widespread adoption of AI Agents and Agentic AI \n(Fig.  1) around 2022 (Before ChatGPT was introduced), the devel-\nopment of autonomous and intelligent agents was deeply rooted in \nfoundational paradigms of artificial intelligence, particularly multi-\nagent systems (MAS) and expert systems, which emphasized social \naction and distributed intelligence [1,2]. Notably, Castelfranchi [3] \nlaid the critical groundwork by introducing ontological categories for \nsocial action, structure, and mind, arguing that sociality emerges from \nindividual agents’ actions and cognitive processes in a shared environ-\nment, with concepts like goal delegation and adoption forming the basis \nfor cooperation and organizational behavior. Similarly, Ferber [4] pro-\nvided a comprehensive framework for MAS, defining agents as entities \nwith autonomy, perception, and communication capabilities, and high-\nlighting their applications in distributed problem-solving, collaborative \nrobotics, and synthetic world simulations.\n∗ Corresponding authors.\nE-mail addresses: rs2672@cornell.edu (R. Sapkota), mk2684@cornell.edu (M. Karkee).\nThese early studies established that individual social actions and \ncognitive architectures are fundamental to modeling collective phe-\nnomena, setting the stage for modern AI Agents. This paper builds on \nthese foundational concepts to explore how social action modeling, as \nproposed in [3,4], informs the design of AI Agents capable of complex, \nsocially intelligent interactions in dynamic environments.\nClassical Agent-like systems were designed to perform specific tasks \nwith predefined rules, which offered limited autonomy, and minimal \nadaptability to dynamic environments. These systems were primar-\nily reactive or deliberative, relying on symbolic reasoning, rule-based \nlogic, or scripted behaviors rather than the learning-driven, context-\naware capabilities of modern AI Agents [5,6]. For instance, expert \nsystems used knowledge bases and inference engines to emulate human \ndecision-making in domains like medical diagnosis (e.g., MYCIN [7]). \nOther notable examples include DENDRAL [8], an expert system for \nmolecular structure prediction; XCON [9], used for computer system \nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.inffus.2025.103599\nReceived 29 May 2025; Received in revised form 25 July 2025; Accepted 30 July 2025\nInformation Fusion 126 (2026) 103599 \nAvailable online 22 August 2025 \n1566-2535/© 2025 The Authors.

Systems like SOAR [11] and the subsumption architecture [12] \nextended symbolic and reactive logic into cognitive modeling and \nrobotics.\nIn addition to task-specific reasoning, these agents supported lim-\nited forms of social interaction. Early conversational systems like \nELIZA [13] and PARRY [14] simulated basic dialogue through pattern \nmatching and script-based responses but lacked genuine understanding \nor contextual adaptation. Similarly, reactive agents in robotics exe-\ncuted sense-act cycles based on fixed control rules, as seen in early \nautonomous platforms like the Stanford Cart [15].\nMulti-agent systems facilitated coordination among distributed en-\ntities, exemplified by auction-based resource allocation in supply chain \nmanagement [16–18]. Scripted AI in video games, like NPC behaviors \nin early RPGs, used predefined decision trees [19]. Furthermore, BDI \n(Belief-Desire-Intention) architectures enabled goal-directed behavior \nin software agents, such as those in air traffic control simulations [20,\n21].\nHowever, across these diverse systems, early AI agents shared com-\nmon limitations: they lacked self-learning, generative reasoning, and \nadaptability to unstructured or evolving environments. These shortcom-\nings distinguish them from Agentic AI a recent paradigm that builds on \ndeep learning, reinforcement learning, and foundation models to enable \nagents with contextual awareness, continuous learning, and emergent \nautonomy [22].\nRecent public, academic and industry interest in AI Agents and \nAgentic AI reflects this broader transition in system capabilities. As \nillustrated in Fig.  1, Google Trends data demonstrates a significant \nrise in global search for both terms following the emergence of large-\nscale generative models in late 2022. This shift is closely tied to the \nevolution of agent design from the pre-2022 era, where AI Agents \noperated in constrained, rule-based environments, to the post-LLM \nperiod marked by learning-driven, flexible/adaptive architectures [23–\n25]. These newer systems enable agents to refine their performance \nover time and interact autonomously with unstructured, dynamic in-\nputs [26–28]. For instance, while pre-modern expert systems required \nmanual updates to static knowledge bases, modern agents leverage \nemergent neural architectures to generalize across tasks [25]. The surge \nin trend activity reflects growing awareness of this technological leap, \nas researchers and practitioners seek tools that go beyond automation \ntoward autonomy and general-purpose reasoning. Moreover, applica-\ntions are no longer confined to narrow domains like simulations or \nlogistics, but now extend to broad practical settings demanding real-\ntime reasoning and adaptive control. This momentum, as visualized in \nFig.  1, highlights the significance of recent architectural advances in \nscaling autonomous agents for real-world deployment.\nThe release of ChatGPT in No...(truncated)"}}, "isError": false}}}
