Conversely, ACP’s architectural flexibil-\\nity, most notably its optional JWS enforcement, translates into high-\\nimpact integrity and confidentiality flaws. We contextualize these find-\\nings within current industry trends, highlighting that existing proto-\\ncols remain insufficiently secure. As a path forward, we recommend\\na hybrid approach that combines CORAL’s integrated architecture\\nwith ACP’s mandatory per-message integrity guarantees, laying the\\ngroundwork for resilient, next-generation agent communications.\\n∗Yedidel Louck and Amit Dvir are with the Department of Computer and Software\\nEngineering, Ariel Cyber Innovation Center, Ariel University, Israel.

These intelligent agents, ca-\\npable of reasoning, planning, delegating, and executing complex workflows,\\nnow form the backbone of applications ranging from supply chain coordi-\\nnation to personalized financial assistance. As the scale and complexity of\\nmulti-agent ecosystems increase, so too do the requirements for secure, in-\\nteroperable communication protocols.\\nCommunication between autonomous agents introduces unique security\\nchallenges. Unlike traditional client-server architectures, agent-based sys-\\ntems must manage peer-to-peer trust, dynamic task delegation, and sensi-\\ntive data sharing across heterogeneous actors. In such environments, the risk\\nof credential leakage, overprivileged access, prompt injection, and unverified\\nexecution grows exponentially [2, 3]. Standard security frameworks such as\\nOAuth 2.0 and TLS, while foundational, do not provide sufficient granular-\\nity or contextual awareness for these interactions, especially in cases where\\nagents dynamically compose tasks involving payments, identity verification,\\nor confidential documents [4, 5].\\nTo address these gaps, several agent communication protocols have been\\ndeveloped, each offering a different perspective on interoperability, trust man-\\nagement, and delegation control [6]. Google’sAgent-to-Agent (A2A)protocol\\n[7] introduces a declarative model for service discovery. TheAgent Commu-\\nnication Protocol (ACP)[8] embraces flexibility with a registry-based model.\\nTheCORAL[9] framework, in contrast, proposes a hybrid architecture inte-\\ngrating on-chain smart contracts for payments with off-chain communication.\\n•Google’sAgent-to-Agent (A2A)protocol [7] introduces a declarative\\nmodel for service discovery.\\n•TheAgent Communication Protocol (ACP)[8] embraces flexibility with\\na registry-based model.\\n•TheCORAL[9] framework, in contrast, proposes a hybrid architec-\\nture integrating on-chain smart contracts for payments with off-chain\\ncommunication.\\nWhile these protocols present promising architectures, their security prop-\\nerties are discussed in the literature but rarely subjected to comparative\\nempirical testing [2]. This study fills this gap by providing a detailed, multi-\\ndimensional security analysis and empirical testing. We establish a 14-point\\n2 vulnerability taxonomy (Section 6), derived from literature and threat mod-\\neling.\\nOur findings reveal a critical ”architecture versus implementation” di-\\nchotomy. We demonstrate that CORAL, while possessing a robust architec-\\nture for integrating payments and securing data integrity via transport-layer\\nvalidation, is critically vulnerable in its current public implementation due\\nto fundamental authentication and authorization failures at its SSE gateway.\\nConversely, our tests confirm that ACP’s architectural flexibility is, in itself,\\na vulnerability, leading to predictable integrity failures and data exfiltra-\\ntion in non-strict configurations. Ultimately, this paper contributes both a\\ncomprehensive security taxonomy and the first empirical benchmark of these\\ncompeting protocols.

This \\nreview critically distinguishes between AI Agents and Agentic AI, offering a structured, conceptual taxonomy, \\napplication mapping, and analysis of opportunities and challenges to clarify their divergent design philosophies \\nand capabilities. We begin by outlining the search strategy and foundational definitions, characterizing AI \\nAgents as modular systems driven and enabled by LLMs and LIMs for task-specific automation. Generative \\nAI is positioned as a precursor providing the foundation, with AI agents advancing through tool integration, \\nprompt engineering, and reasoning enhancements. We then characterize Agentic AI systems, which, in contrast \\nto AI Agents, represent a paradigm shift marked by multi-agent collaboration, dynamic task decomposition, \\npersistent memory, and coordinated autonomy. Through a chronological evaluation of architectural evolution, \\noperational mechanisms, interaction styles, and autonomy levels, we present a comparative analysis across \\nboth AI agents and agentic AI paradigms. Application domains enabled by AI Agents such as customer \\nsupport, scheduling, and data summarization are then contrasted with Agentic AI deployments in research \\nautomation, robotic coordination, and medical decision support. We further examine unique challenges in \\neach paradigm including hallucination, brittleness, emergent behavior, and coordination failure, and propose \\ntargeted solutions such as ReAct loops, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), automation coordination layers, \\nand causal modeling. This work aims to provide a roadmap for developing robust, scalable, and explainable \\nAI-driven systems.\\n1. Introduction\\nPrior to the widespread adoption of AI Agents and Agentic AI \\n(Fig.  1) around 2022 (Before ChatGPT was introduced), the devel-\\nopment of autonomous and intelligent agents was deeply rooted in \\nfoundational paradigms of artificial intelligence, particularly multi-\\nagent systems (MAS) and expert systems, which emphasized social \\naction and distributed intelligence [1,2]. Notably, Castelfranchi [3] \\nlaid the critical groundwork by introducing ontological categories for \\nsocial action, structure, and mind, arguing that sociality emerges from \\nindividual agents’ actions and cognitive processes in a shared environ-\\nment, with concepts like goal delegation and adoption forming the basis \\nfor cooperation and organizational behavior. Similarly, Ferber [4] pro-\\nvided a comprehensive framework for MAS, defining agents as entities \\nwith autonomy, perception, and communication capabilities, and high-\\nlighting their applications in distributed problem-solving, collaborative \\nrobotics, and synthetic world simulations.\\n∗ Corresponding authors.\\nE-mail addresses: rs2672@cornell.edu (R. Sapkota), mk2684@cornell.edu (M. Karkee).\\nThese early studies established that individual social actions and \\ncognitive architectures are fundamental to modeling collective phe-\\nnomena, setting the stage for modern AI Agents. This paper builds on \\nthese foundational concepts to explore how social action modeling, as \\nproposed in [3,4], informs the design of AI Agents capable of complex, \\nsocially intelligent interactions in dynamic environments.\\nClassical Agent-like systems were designed to perform specific tasks \\nwith predefined rules, which offered limited autonomy, and minimal \\nadaptability to dynamic environments. These systems were primar-\\nily reactive or deliberative, relying on symbolic reasoning, rule-based \\nlogic, or scripted behaviors rather than the learning-driven, context-\\naware capabilities of modern AI Agents [5,6].
