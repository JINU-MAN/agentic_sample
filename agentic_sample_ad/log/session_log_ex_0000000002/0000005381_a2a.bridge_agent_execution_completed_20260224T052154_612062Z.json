    "response": "Okay, I will search for news articles and brokerage reports about Samsung Electronics stock price fluctuations in the last two weeks, focusing on South Korea (대한민국) as the region, and 2026년 2월 (February 2026) as the time, although this seems like a future date. Given the user's instruction to \"알아서 판단해봐\", I will adjust the timeframe to the *last two weeks from today*, as originally specified in the task goal.\n\nHere are the search queries I will use:\n\n1. \"Samsung Electronics stock price news last two weeks\"\n2. \"삼성전자 주가 뉴스 최근 2주\" (Korean for \"Samsung Electronics stock price news last two weeks\")\n3. \"Samsung Electronics stock brokerage report last two weeks\"\n4. \"삼성전자 증권사 리포트 최근 2주\" (Korean for \"Samsung Electronics brokerage report last two weeks\")\n5. \"Samsung stock price fluctuation last two weeks\"\n6. \"삼성 주가 변동 최근 2주\" (Korean for \"Samsung stock price fluctuation last two weeks\")\nThe search results are not very relevant, mainly linking to the Samsung community page and general Samsung pages. I will try a different approach, focusing on financial news and reports.\n\nHere are the revised search queries:\n\n1. \"Samsung Electronics stock price news site:bloomberg.com OR site:reuters.com last two weeks\"\n2. \"Samsung Electronics stock analysis report site:investors.com OR site:marketwatch.com last two weeks\"\n3. \"삼성전자 주가 뉴스 site:naver.com/news OR site:mk.co.kr 최근 2주\"\n4. \"삼성전자 증권사 리포트 site:naver.com/news OR site:hankyung.com 최근 2주\"\nThere are no results for the refined search queries. It's possible that the timeframe is too narrow, or that the search terms are too specific. I will broaden the timeframe to one month and simplify the queries slightly. Also, I will remove the site restrictions to see if I can get any results at all.\n\nRevised search queries:\n\n1. \"Samsung Electronics stock price news last month\"\n2. \"Samsung Electronics stock analysis report last month\"\n3. \"삼성전자 주가 뉴스 최근 한달\"\n4. \"삼성전자 증권사 리포트 최근 한달\"\nThe results are still largely irrelevant. The Samsung community pages are not useful for this task.\n\nI need to re-evaluate my strategy. The lack of results suggests either:\n1.  There hasn't been significant news about Samsung stock in the last month, or\n2.  My search terms are still not effective.\n\nI will try a more general search to see if I can identify any relevant trends or news items, and focus on Korean sources as well, since that was specified by the user.\n\nRevised Search Queries:\n\n1.  \"Samsung Electronics stock market news\"\n2.  \"삼성전자 주식 시장 뉴스\" (Samsung Electronics stock market news)\n3.  \"Samsung stock analysis\"\n4.  \"삼성 주식 분석\" (Samsung stock analysis)\nThe search results consistently return the same irrelevant Samsung community and official pages. This strongly suggests that there is either a problem with the search tool, or that there genuinely is a lack of readily available news and reports about Samsung's stock price fluctuations. Given that several attempts with different queries and timeframes have failed, I suspect an issue with the search tool.\n\nAdditional Needs:\n- [MainAgent] Confirm that the search tool is functioning correctly. If the tool is confirmed to be working, then inform the user that no relevant news articles or brokerage reports about Samsung Electronics stock price fluctuations could be found within the specified timeframe."
