The first one is in Russian and about Google Docs. It seems my queries are too broad. I will try again with more specific queries.\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"query\": \"Samsung Electronics stock price change last 2 weeks\",\n    \"max_results_per_query\": 4\n  },\n  {\n    \"query\": \"Samsung stock news price drop\",\n    \"max_results_per_query\": 4\n  },\n  {\n    \"query\": \"Samsung Electronics stock outlook recent\",\n    \"max_results_per_query\": 4\n  },\n  {\n    \"query\": \"005930.KS stock analysis recent\",\n    \"max_results_per_query\": 4\n  },\n  {\n    \"query\": \"Samsung stock dividend news\",\n    \"max_results_per_query\": 4\n  }\n]\n```\nThe search results are still not relevant and point to the same Google Docs page. It seems like the search engine is not working correctly.\n\nSince the web search is failing, I will request that the user clarify which region/time range should be prioritized in case the default search is biased.\n```\nAdditional Needs:\n- [MainAgent] Ask user which region/time range should be prioritized.\n```"
