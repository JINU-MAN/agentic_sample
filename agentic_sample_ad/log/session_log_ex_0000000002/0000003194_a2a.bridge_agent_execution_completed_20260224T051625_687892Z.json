    "response": "Okay, I need to find news articles and brokerage reports related to Samsung Electronics stock price fluctuations in South Korea during February 2026. I will use `search_web_candidates_with_mcp` to find relevant URLs and then `fetch_web_page_with_mcp` to extract the text from the most promising candidates.\n\nHere are my query candidates:\n1. \"Samsung Electronics stock price February 2026 South Korea\"\n2. \"삼성전자 주가 2026년 2월 대한민국\" (Korean for \"Samsung Electronics stock price February 2026 South Korea\")\n3. \"Samsung Electronics stock report February 2026 South Korea\"\n4. \"삼성전자 증권 리포트 2026년 2월 대한민국\" (Korean for \"Samsung Electronics securities report February 2026 South Korea\")\n5. \"Samsung stock news February 2026 South Korea\"\n6. \"삼성 주식 뉴스 2026년 2월 대한민국\" (Korean for \"Samsung stock news February 2026 South Korea\")\nThe initial search results are not very promising. Most of them are links to the Samsung community or general Samsung pages. I will try fetching the two links that are in Korean to see if they provide relevant information.\nBoth of the fetched pages are general Samsung website pages and don't contain information about Samsung Electronics stock price fluctuations in February 2026. The search results are not providing relevant information. Since the original request was for news articles *and* brokerage reports, I will focus my queries on brokerage reports specifically. I will also try a broader search without the specific month.\n\nHere are my new query candidates:\n1. \"Samsung Electronics stock report 2026 South Korea\"\n2. \"삼성전자 증권 리포트 2026 대한민국\"\n3. \"Samsung stock analysis 2026 South Korea\"\n4. \"삼성 주식 분석 2026 대한민국\"\nThe search results continue to be dominated by irrelevant links to the Samsung community and general Samsung pages. It is possible that there is limited information available online about Samsung Electronics stock specifically for February 2026, as it is still in the future. Given the lack of relevant web results, I will request a search for academic papers.\n\nAdditional Needs:\n- [PaperAnalyst] Find academic papers that predict or analyze Samsung Electronics stock price fluctuations."
