I will use the `search_web_candidates_with_mcp` tool to find relevant news articles.\n\nHere are my query candidates:\n1. \"Samsung Electronics latest news\"\n2. \"Samsung news today\"\n3. \"Samsung Electronics news update\"\n4. \"Recent developments at Samsung\"\n5. \"Samsung Electronics breaking news\"\n6. \"Samsung company news\"\nThe search results are filled with entries from the Samsung Community website and crossword puzzle answers, and many are dated in the future. This is very strange. I'm going to try a different set of queries that are more specific and should filter out some of the noise.\n\nHere are my new query candidates:\n1. \"Samsung Electronics news release\"\n2. \"Samsung press release\"\n3. \"Samsung official news\"\n4. \"Samsung latest announcements\"\n5. \"Samsung Electronics recent news\"\nThe results are still showing the same strange Samsung Community results with dates in the future. I suspect there might be something wrong with the search engine or the way it's interpreting my queries. I'm going to try one more time, but this time I will add the current date to the query to see if that helps.\n\nHere are my final query candidates:\n1. \"Samsung Electronics news release January 26 2026\"\n2. \"Samsung press release January 26 2026\"\nThe search results are consistently returning irrelevant information, primarily from the Samsung Community and with incorrect dates. It seems the search tool is not functioning as expected. I cannot reliably find a relevant news article about Samsung Electronics with the current tool.\n\nAdditional Needs:\n- [MainAgent] Please investigate the search tool's functionality and determine why it is returning irrelevant results with incorrect dates."
