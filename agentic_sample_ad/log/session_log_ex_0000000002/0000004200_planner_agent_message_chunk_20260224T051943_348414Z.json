Summarize User Goal:\nThe user wants an analysis of Samsung Electronics stock price fluctuations over the past two weeks, gathered from news articles and brokerage reports, summarized and posted to the Slack channel \"agentic\". The user is allowing the agent to determine the best course of action, as they responded '알아서 판단해봐' (figure it out yourself).\n\n2. Plan:\n1. **Determine the specific timeframe:** Since the user specified \"recent 2 weeks\" and is allowing for independent judgment, define the start and end dates for the analysis period. For example, consider the 2 weeks prior to today's date. No agent is needed. I will use today's date and subtract 14 days.\n2. **Search for news articles and brokerage reports:** Use the `WebSearchAnalyst` to search for relevant news articles and brokerage reports about Samsung Electronics stock price fluctuations within the determined timeframe.\n3. **Summarize the findings from news articles:** Use the `WebSearchAnalyst` to summarize the key information about stock price fluctuations from the retrieved news articles.\n4. **Summarize the findings from brokerage reports:** Use the `PaperAnalyst` to analyze brokerage reports. Brokerage reports are often in PDF format.\n5. **Combine the Summaries:** Combine the summaries from news articles and brokerage reports into a single, coherent analysis. No agent is needed.\n6. **Post the Analysis to Slack:** Use the `MainAgent` to post the combined analysis to the \"agentic\" Slack channel.\n\n3. Execution Steps:\n\n| Step | Agent | Input |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1 | N/A | Determine the start and end dates for the analysis period (2 weeks prior to today). I will use today's date and subtract 14 days. |\n| 2 | WebSearchAnalyst | Search for news articles and brokerage reports about Samsung Electronics stock price fluctuations between [start date] and [end date].
