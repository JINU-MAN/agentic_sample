The user's latest request is to find just one recent news article.\n\nSince the search tool seems to be malfunctioning, I need to confirm this before proceeding. I'll try to use the tool directly with a very simple query and check the result. If it still returns garbage, I'll report the problem.\n\nI will try searching for \"today news\" to see if the tool returns relevant results with correct dates.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"needs\": [\n    {\n      \"target\": \"WebSearchAnalyst\",\n      \"request\": \"Search for 'today news' and summarize the first result.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
