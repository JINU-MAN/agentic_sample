The search tool is functioning, but it is not providing accurate results for specific company news like Samsung. It returns general news when searching for 'today news', but fails to find relevant information about Samsung, often providing irrelevant results with incorrect dates.\"\n\nNow, I will use the `slack_post_message` tool to send this message to the 'agentic' channel.\nThe message has been posted to the Slack channel."
