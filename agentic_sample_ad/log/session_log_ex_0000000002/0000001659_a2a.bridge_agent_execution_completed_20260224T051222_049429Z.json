    "response": "Okay, I need to find news articles about Samsung Electronics' stock price fluctuations over the last two weeks. Here's my plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Query Candidates:** I'll generate several search queries targeting news articles about Samsung stock price changes in the past two weeks.\n2.  **Search the Web:** I'll use the `search_web_candidates_with_mcp` tool to search the web using my query candidates.\n3.  **Evaluate Relevance:** I'll examine the search results to identify articles that specifically discuss Samsung's stock price fluctuations within the specified timeframe.\n4.  **Fetch Relevant Pages:** I'll use `fetch_web_page_with_mcp` to fetch the content of the most relevant articles.\n5.  **Summarize Findings:** I will pass the URLs of the relevant articles to the next step to be summarized.\n\nHere are my query candidates:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"queries_json\": \"[\\\"Samsung stock price last 2 weeks\\\", \\\"Samsung Electronics stock fluctuation recent\\\", \\\"Samsung share price news\\\", \\\"Samsung stock market performance last two weeks\\\", \\\"삼성전자 주가 최근 2주\\\", \\\"Samsung stock analysis recent\\\"]\"\n}\n```\nThe search results are not very relevant. It seems that the query was interpreted as a dictionary definition request. I'll try again, simplifying the query and focusing on news sources.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"queries_json\": \"[\\\"Samsung stock price news last 2 weeks\\\", \\\"Samsung Electronics stock news recent\\\", \\\"Samsung share price news today\\\", \\\"삼성전자 주가 뉴스 최근\\\"]\"\n}\n```\nThe search results are still returning dictionary definitions. I will try again, this time I will include the date range within the query and focus on Korean news.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"queries_json\": \"[\\\"삼성전자 주가 뉴스 2주\\\", \\\"최근 2주 삼성전자 주가\\\", \\\"Samsung stock news Korea recent\\\"]\"\n}\n```\nThe results are still poor and lead to university pages or community pages. It seems the search engine is misinterpreting the queries, possibly due to the way the queries are structured. I will try structuring the queries differently and including the word \"stock price\" to make the intent clearer.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"queries_json\": \"[\\\"Samsung Electronics stock price news in Korea\\\", \\\"News about Samsung stock price\\\", \\\"Recent Samsung stock price news\\\"]\"\n}\n```\nStill getting irrelevant results. It appears the search engine is struggling to understand my intent, possibly due to the recentness constraint. I will drop the \"recent\" constraint and broaden the search, then filter the results manually.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"queries_json\": \"[\\\"Samsung Electronics stock price news\\\", \\\"Samsung share price Korea\\\"]\"\n}\n```\nThe results are consistently returning definitions of \"queries\". I suspect there is an issue with how the tool is interpreting my query. Since I am unable to get any relevant results using this tool I will request help from the MainAgent to clarify the proper usage of the search tool.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"needs\": [\n    {\n      \"target\": \"MainAgent\",\n      \"request\": \"Please clarify the proper usage of the `search_web_candidates_with_mcp` tool. I am attempting to find news articles about Samsung Electronics' stock price fluctuations over the last two weeks, but the tool consistently returns definitions of 'queries' regardless of how I phrase the query.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
