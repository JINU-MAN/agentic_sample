I will focus on papers relevant to South Korea. Since the user specified \"2026년 2월\", I will start by searching for papers related to forecasting or analyzing Samsung's stock price, focusing on the South Korean market, and then expand the search if needed. I will use the workflow ID 'cf177c9d15814682bf140f2270f1e135-dddfbbb7' for all memory operations.\nThe initial search with the query \"Samsung Electronics stock price prediction South Korea\" returned two papers, but their titles and previews don't seem directly relevant to the stock price analysis. The titles are \"AI Agents vs. Agentic AI...\" and \"AE: An Asymmetric Extremum Content Defined Chunking Algorithm...\". These papers seem to be related to AI agents and data deduplication algorithms, respectively, and only tangentially related to the query.\n\nI will now broaden the search to include papers that analyze factors influencing stock prices in the South Korean market generally, and then expand the memory with more specific queries if needed.\nThis search also didn't yield directly relevant results. The papers are \"Security Analysis of Agentic Communication Protocols\" and \"Probabilistic-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-for-Big-Data-Applications\".\n\nI will try a more general search for papers analyzing stock market factors, without specifying the region initially, and then filter for South Korea-specific content within those papers.\nStill no directly relevant papers. It seems the local database lacks relevant papers based on these initial queries. I will try scraping papers directly using a broad query.\nThe scraped papers are still not relevant. It seems the local paper database does not have the necessary information.\n\nAdditional Needs:\n- [MainAgent] Ask user to narrow domain, timeframe, or keywords."
