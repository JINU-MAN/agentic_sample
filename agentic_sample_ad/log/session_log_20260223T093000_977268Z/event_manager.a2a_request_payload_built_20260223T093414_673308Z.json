Format the message appropriately, including the blog post's title, a brief summary, and the link to the blog post.\n\nExpected handoff deliverable:\nA message posted to the 'agentic' Slack channel with a summary of the blog post and a link to the blog post.\n\nPlanner tool hints for this step:\n- web_summary\n- slack_post_message\n\nAgent available tools:\nsearch_web_candidates_with_mcp, fetch_web_page_with_mcp, slack_post_message\n\nRules:\n- Focus only on this step.\n- Use previous step outputs as key input.\n- Decide your own approach and choose tools based on this step goal.\n- Use indirect delegation only: do not call other agents directly from this step.\n- If a specialist can improve quality, request it in `Additional Needs` as `[TargetAgentName] concrete request`.\n- MainAgent will convert unresolved additional needs into replanned steps when feasible.\n- Do not rely on fixed keyword templates unless user explicitly provided exact terms.\n- If local evidence is insufficient, request follow-up work from another agent.\n- If user clarification is required, ask MainAgent to request clarification.\n- Return output that the next step (or user) can directly consume.\n\nAvailable agents for additional-need targeting:\nPaperAnalyst, SocialMediaAnalyst, WebSearchAnalyst, MainAgent\n\nAgent capability profiles:\n- PaperAnalyst: capabilities=paper_search, paper_summary, paper_fulltext_memory, paper_memory_query, slack_post, paperanalyst, scrape_papers_with_mcp, load_paper_memory_with_mcp, expand_paper_memory_with_mcp, query_paper_memory, slack_post_message; tools=scrape_papers_with_mcp, load_paper_memory_with_mcp, expand_paper_memory_with_mcp, query_paper_memory, slack_post_message\n- SocialMediaAnalyst: capabilities=sns_search, sns_summary, slack_post, socialmediaanalyst, scrape_sns_with_mcp, slack_post_message; tools=scrape_sns_with_mcp, slack_post_message\n- MainAgent: coordination, replanning, user-clarification routing\n\nConversation context (recent turns):\nuser: 슬랙 agentic 채널에 프롬프트 인젝션 관련 논문 하나 찾아서 올려줘\nassistant: === Plan ===\nHere's my plan to find a research paper on prompt injection and post it to the Slack agentic channel:\n\n**Summary:** Find a research paper related to prompt injection and post it to the specified Slack channel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Find a relevant paper:** Use the `PaperAnalyst` agent with the `scrape_papers_with_mcp` tool to search for papers related to \"prompt injection.\" The agent will determine the appropriate search queries.\n    *   Agent: `PaperAnalyst`\n    *   Input: `{ \"query\": \"prompt injection\" }`\n\n2.  **Post the paper to Slack:** Use the `PaperAnalyst` agent with the `slack_post_message` tool to post the found paper to the \"agentic\" Slack channel. The agent will determine the best way to format the message, including the paper's title and a link to the paper (if available).\n    *   Agent: `PaperAnalyst`\n    *   Input: `{ \"channel\": \"agentic\", \"message\":  <<the paper found in step 1>> }`\n\n=== Execution Results ===\n\n[Step 1 - PaperAnalyst]\nGoal: Find a research paper related to 'prompt injection'. Determine appropriate search queries and retrieve relevant papers.\nI will search for a research paper related to \"prompt injection\" and prepare the information for posting to the Slack channel.\nThe search results returned a few papers. The paper \"Security Analysis of Agentic Communication Protocols.pdf\" seems the most relevant due to its higher score (20) and the mention of \"prompt injection\" in the preview.\n\nI will proceed with this paper.\n\nAdditional Needs: none\n\n[Step 2 - PaperAnalyst]\nGoal: Post the paper \"Security Analysis of Agentic Communication Protocols.pdf\" to the 'agentic' Slack channel. Format the message appropriately, including the paper's title and a link if available.\nOkay, I will post the paper \"Security Analysis of Agentic Communication Protocols.pdf\" to the 'agentic' Slack channel.\nI have posted the message to the 'agentic' Slack channel.\n\nAdditional Needs: none\n\n=== Final Summary ===\nThe research paper \"Security Analysis of Agentic Communication Protocols.pdf\" has been posted to the 'agentic' Slack channel.\nuser: BERT에 대해 가장 잘 설명하는 블로그  찾아서 내용 정리하고 링크랑 같이 슬랙 agentic 채널에 올려줘\n\nOriginal user request:\nBERT에 대해 가장 잘 설명하는 블로그  찾아서 내용 정리하고 링크랑 같이 슬랙 agentic 채널에 올려줘\n\nShared progress context:\nPrevious step outputs:\n[Step 1 - WebSearchAnalyst]\nOkay, I will find the best blog post explaining BERT. Here's my plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Search Queries:** Based on the user's request, I'll generate a few search queries to find relevant blog posts.\n2.  **Search the Web:** I'll use the `search_web_candidates_with_mcp` tool with the generated queries to find potential blog posts.\n3.  **Evaluate and Select:** I'll evaluate the search results based on relevance and select the blog post that best explains BERT.\n4.  **Return the URL:** I'll return the URL of the selected blog post.\n\nHere are the search queries I'll use:\n\n*   \"best blog post explaining BERT\"\n*   \"BERT explained blog\"\n*   \"BERT tutorial blog\"\n*   \"introduction to BERT blog\"\n*   \"understanding BERT blog post\"\nBased on the search results, here are a few potential blog posts:\n\n*   [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nlp/explanation-of-bert-model-nlp/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nlp/explanation-of-bert-model-nlp/) - \"BERT Model - NLP - GeeksforGeeks\"\n*   [https://www.snowflake.com/en/fundamentals/bert/](https://www.snowflake.com/en/fundamentals/bert/) - \"What Is BERT ? NLP Model Explained - Snowflake\"\n\nI will select the GeeksforGeeks blog post as the best candidate based on the title and the snippet suggesting it's an explanation of the BERT model.\nOkay, I have fetched the content of the GeeksforGeeks blog post.\n\n```\nURL: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nlp/explanation-of-bert-model-nlp/\n```\n\nAdditional Needs: none\n\n[Step 2 - WebSearchAnalyst]\nThe GeeksforGeeks blog post provides an explanation of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model in NLP. It covers the background of BERT, highlighting the limitations of previous models like Word2Vec and GloVe, which couldn't handle word context effectively. BERT, developed by Google, addresses this by considering the full context of a word in a sentence. The blog likely dives into BERT's architecture, pre-training tasks (Masked Language Modeling and Next Sentence Prediction), and its applications.\n\nAdditional Needs: none\n\nOpen additional needs:\n(none)\n\nCurrent remaining planned steps:\n(none)\n\nOutput format:\n1) Main response for this step.\n2) Additional needs under heading 'Additional Needs:'.\n   - If none: `Additional Needs: none`\n   - If needed, use bullets with target prefix:\n     - [TargetAgentName] concrete request\n   - TargetAgentName must be one of the available agents listed above."
