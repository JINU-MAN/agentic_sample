Format the message appropriately, including the paper's title and a link if available.\n\nExpected handoff deliverable:\nA message posted to the 'agentic' Slack channel with the paper's information.\n\nPlanner tool hints for this step:\n- slack_post_message\n\nAgent available tools:\nscrape_papers_with_mcp, load_paper_memory_with_mcp, expand_paper_memory_with_mcp, query_paper_memory, slack_post_message\n\nRules:\n- Focus only on this step.\n- Use previous step outputs as key input.\n- Decide your own approach and choose tools based on this step goal.\n- Use indirect delegation only: do not call other agents directly from this step.\n- If a specialist can improve quality, request it in `Additional Needs` as `[TargetAgentName] concrete request`.\n- MainAgent will convert unresolved additional needs into replanned steps when feasible.\n- Do not rely on fixed keyword templates unless user explicitly provided exact terms.\n- If local evidence is insufficient, request follow-up work from another agent.\n- If user clarification is required, ask MainAgent to request clarification.\n- Return output that the next step (or user) can directly consume.\n\nAvailable agents for additional-need targeting:\nPaperAnalyst, SocialMediaAnalyst, WebSearchAnalyst, MainAgent\n\nAgent capability profiles:\n- SocialMediaAnalyst: capabilities=sns_search, sns_summary, slack_post, socialmediaanalyst, scrape_sns_with_mcp, slack_post_message; tools=scrape_sns_with_mcp, slack_post_message\n- WebSearchAnalyst: capabilities=web_search, web_summary, fact_check, slack_post, websearchanalyst, search_web_candidates_with_mcp, fetch_web_page_with_mcp, slack_post_message; tools=search_web_candidates_with_mcp, fetch_web_page_with_mcp, slack_post_message\n- MainAgent: coordination, replanning, user-clarification routing\n\nConversation context (recent turns):\nuser: 슬랙 agentic 채널에 프롬프트 인젝션 관련 논문 하나 찾아서 올려줘\n\nOriginal user request:\n슬랙 agentic 채널에 프롬프트 인젝션 관련 논문 하나 찾아서 올려줘\n\nShared progress context:\nPrevious step outputs:\n[Step 1 - PaperAnalyst]\nI will search for a research paper related to \"prompt injection\" and prepare the information for posting to the Slack channel.\nThe search results returned a few papers. The paper \"Security Analysis of Agentic Communication Protocols.pdf\" seems the most relevant due to its higher score (20) and the mention of \"prompt injection\" in the preview.\n\nI will proceed with this paper.\n\nAdditional Needs: none\n\nOpen additional needs:\n(none)\n\nCurrent remaining planned steps:\n(none)\n\nOutput format:\n1) Main response for this step.\n2) Additional needs under heading 'Additional Needs:'.\n   - If none: `Additional Needs: none`\n   - If needed, use bullets with target prefix:\n     - [TargetAgentName] concrete request\n   - TargetAgentName must be one of the available agents listed above.",
