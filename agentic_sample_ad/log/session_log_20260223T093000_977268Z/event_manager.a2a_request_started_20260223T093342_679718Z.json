    "user_message": "You are participating in a multi-agent collaboration workflow.\nCurrent step: 1/4\nAssigned agent: WebSearchAnalyst\n\nWorkflow ID: 4de9f56c247a4d2a8c6e8234f8321bdb-ca7e97e6\n\nStep goal:\nFind the best blog post explaining BERT. Determine appropriate search queries to identify relevant blog posts and return the top candidate.\n\nExpected handoff deliverable:\nURL of the best blog post explaining BERT.\n\nPlanner tool hints for this step:\n- search_web_candidates_with_mcp\n\nAgent available tools:\nsearch_web_candidates_with_mcp, fetch_web_page_with_mcp, slack_post_message\n\nRules:\n- Focus only on this step.\n- Use previous step outputs as key input.\n- Decide your own approach and choose tools based on this step goal.\n- Use indirect delegation only: do not call other agents directly from this step.\n- If a specialist can improve quality, request it in `Additional Needs` as `[TargetAgentName] concrete request`.\n- MainAgent will convert unresolved additional needs into replanned steps when feasible.\n- Do not rely on fixed keyword templates unless user explicitly provided exact terms.\n- If local evidence is insufficient, request follow-up work from another agent.\n- If user clarification is required, ask MainAgent to request clarification.\n- Return output that the next step (or user) can directly consume.\n\nAvailable agents for additional-need targeting:\nPaperAnalyst, SocialMediaAnalyst, WebSearchAnalyst, MainAgent\n\nAgent capability profiles:\n- PaperAnalyst: capabilities=paper_search, paper_summary, paper_fulltext_memory, paper_memory_query, slack_post, paperanalyst, scrape_papers_with_mcp, load_paper_memory_with_mcp, expand_paper_memory_with_mcp, query_paper_memory, slack_post_message; tools=scrape_papers_with_mcp, load_paper_memory_with_mcp, expand_paper_memory_with_mcp, query_paper_memory, slack_post_message\n- SocialMediaAnalyst: capabilities=sns_search, sns_summary, slack_post, socialmediaanalyst, scrape_sns_with_mcp, slack_post_message; tools=scrape_sns_with_mcp, slack_post_message\n- MainAgent: coordination, replanning, user-clarification routing\n\nConversation context (recent turns):\nuser: 슬랙 agentic 채널에 프롬프트 인젝션 관련 논문 하나 찾아서 올려줘\nassistant: === Plan ===\nHere's my plan to find a research paper on prompt injection and post it to the Slack agentic channel:\n\n**Summary:** Find a research paper related to prompt injection and post it to the specified Slack channel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Find a relevant paper:** Use the `PaperAnalyst` agent with the `scrape_papers_with_mcp` tool to search for papers related to \"prompt injection.\" The agent will determine the appropriate search queries.\n    *   Agent: `PaperAnalyst`\n    *   Input: `{ \"query\": \"prompt injection\" }`\n\n2.  **Post the paper to Slack:** Use the `PaperAnalyst` agent with the `slack_post_message` tool to post the found paper to the \"agentic\" Slack channel. The agent will determine the best way to format the message, including the paper's title and a link to the paper (if available).\n    *   Agent: `PaperAnalyst`\n    *   Input: `{ \"channel\": \"agentic\", \"message\":  <<the paper found in step 1>> }`\n\n=== Execution Results ===\n\n[Step 1 - PaperAnalyst]\nGoal: Find a research paper related to 'prompt injection'. Determine appropriate search queries and retrieve relevant papers.\nI will search for a research paper related to \"prompt injection\" and prepare the information for posting to the Slack channel.\nThe search results returned a few papers. The paper \"Security Analysis of Agentic Communication Protocols.pdf\" seems the most relevant due to its higher score (20) and the mention of \"prompt injection\" in the preview.\n\nI will proceed with this paper.\n\nAdditional Needs: none\n\n[Step 2 - PaperAnalyst]\nGoal: Post the paper \"Security Analysis of Agentic Communication Protocols.pdf\" to the 'agentic' Slack channel. Format the message appropriately, including the paper's title and a link if available.\nOkay, I will post the paper \"Security Analysis of Agentic Communication Protocols.pdf\" to the 'agentic' Slack channel.\nI have posted the message to the 'agentic' Slack channel.\n\nAdditional Needs: none\n\n=== Final Summary ===\nThe research paper \"Security Analysis of Agentic Communication Protocols.pdf\" has been posted to the 'agentic' Slack channel.\nuser: BERT에 대해 가장 잘 설명하는 블로그  찾아서 내용 정리하고 링크랑 같이 슬랙 agentic 채널에 올려줘\n\nOriginal user request:\nBERT에 대해 가장 잘 설명하는 블로그  찾아서 내용 정리하고 링크랑 같이 슬랙 agentic 채널에 올려줘\n\nShared progress context:\nPrevious step outputs:\n(none)\n\nOpen additional needs:\n(none)\n\nCurrent remaining planned steps:\n1. WebSearchAnalyst - Fetch the content of the blog post identified in step 1. (tool_hints: fetch_web_page_with_mcp)\n2. WebSearchAnalyst - Summarize the fetched content of the blog post. (tool_hints: web_summary)\n3. WebSearchAnalyst - Post the summary and link of the blog post to the 'agentic' Slack channel. Format the message appropriately, including the blog post's title, a brief summary, and the link to the blog post. (tool_hints: slack_post_message)\n\nOutput format:\n1) Main response for this step.\n2) Additional needs under heading 'Additional Needs:'.\n   - If none: `Additional Needs: none`\n   - If needed, use bullets with target prefix:\n     - [TargetAgentName] concrete request\n   - TargetAgentName must be one of the available agents listed above.",
