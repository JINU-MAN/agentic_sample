The agent will determine the appropriate search queries to identify relevant blog posts.\n    *   Agent: `WebSearchAnalyst`\n    *   Input: `{ \"query\": \"best blog post explaining BERT\" }`\n\n2.  **Fetch the content of the blog post:** Use the `WebSearchAnalyst` agent with the `fetch_web_page_with_mcp` tool to fetch the content of the blog post identified in step 1.\n    *   Agent: `WebSearchAnalyst`\n    *   Input: `{ \"url\": \"<<URL of the best blog post identified in step 1>>\" }`\n\n3.  **Summarize the blog post:** Use the `WebSearchAnalyst` agent with the `web_summary` capability to summarize the fetched content of the blog post.\n    *   Agent: `WebSearchAnalyst`\n    *   Input: `{ \"text\": \"<<Content of the blog post fetched in step 2>>\" }`\n\n4.  **Post the summary and link to Slack:** Use the `WebSearchAnalyst` agent with the `slack_post_message` tool to post the summary and link of the blog post to the \"agentic\" Slack channel. The agent will determine the best way to format the message, including the blog post's title, a brief summary, and the link to the blog post.\n    *   Agent: `WebSearchAnalyst`\n    *   Input: `{ \"channel\": \"agentic\", \"message\": \"<<Summary of the blog post from step 3>>\\n<<Link to the blog post from step 1>>\" }`",
