It covers the background of BERT, highlighting the limitations of previous models like Word2Vec and GloVe, which couldn't handle word context effectively. BERT, developed by Google, addresses this by considering the full context of a word in a sentence. The blog likely dives into BERT's architecture, pre-training tasks (Masked Language Modeling and Next Sentence Prediction), and its applications.\n\nAdditional Needs: none",
