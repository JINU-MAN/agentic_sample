The agent will determine the best way to format the message, including the paper's title and a link to the paper (if available).\n    *   Agent: `PaperAnalyst`\n    *   Input: `{ \"channel\": \"agentic\", \"message\":  <<the paper found in step 1>> }`\n\n=== Execution Results ===\n\n[Step 1 - PaperAnalyst]\nGoal: Find a research paper related to 'prompt injection'. Determine appropriate search queries and retrieve relevant papers.\nI will search for a research paper related to \"prompt injection\" and prepare the information for posting to the Slack channel.\nThe search results returned a few papers. The paper \"Security Analysis of Agentic Communication Protocols.pdf\" seems the most relevant due to its higher score (20) and the mention of \"prompt injection\" in the preview.\n\nI will proceed with this paper.\n\nAdditional Needs: none\n\n[Step 2 - PaperAnalyst]\nGoal: Post the paper \"Security Analysis of Agentic Communication Protocols.pdf\" to the 'agentic' Slack channel. Format the message appropriately, including the paper's title and a link if available.\nOkay, I will post the paper \"Security Analysis of Agentic Communication Protocols.pdf\" to the 'agentic' Slack channel.\nI have posted the message to the 'agentic' Slack channel.\n\nAdditional Needs: none\n\n=== Final Summary ===\nThe research paper \"Security Analysis of Agentic Communication Protocols.pdf\" has been posted to the 'agentic' Slack channel."
