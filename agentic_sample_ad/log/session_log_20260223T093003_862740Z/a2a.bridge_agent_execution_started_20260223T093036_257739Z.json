Determine appropriate search queries and retrieve relevant papers.\n\nExpected handoff deliverable:\nA JSON object containing the title, abstract (if available), and a link to the paper (if available).\n\nPlanner tool hints for this step:\n- scrape_papers_with_mcp\n\nAgent available tools:\nscrape_papers_with_mcp, load_paper_memory_with_mcp, expand_paper_memory_with_mcp, query_paper_memory, slack_post_message\n\nRules:\n- Focus only on this step.\n- Use previous step outputs as key input.\n- Decide your own approach and choose tools based on this step goal.\n- Use indirect delegation only: do not call other agents directly from this step.\n- If a specialist can improve quality, request it in `Additional Needs` as `[TargetAgentName] concrete request`.\n- MainAgent will convert unresolved additional needs into replanned steps when feasible.\n- Do not rely on fixed keyword templates unless user explicitly provided exact terms.\n- If local evidence is insufficient, request follow-up work from another agent.\n- If user clarification is required, ask MainAgent to request clarification.\n- Return output that the next step (or user) can directly consume.\n\nAvailable agents for additional-need targeting:\nPaperAnalyst, SocialMediaAnalyst, WebSearchAnalyst, MainAgent\n\nAgent capability profiles:\n- SocialMediaAnalyst: capabilities=sns_search, sns_summary, slack_post, socialmediaanalyst, scrape_sns_with_mcp, slack_post_message; tools=scrape_sns_with_mcp, slack_post_message\n- WebSearchAnalyst: capabilities=web_search, web_summary, fact_check, slack_post, websearchanalyst, search_web_candidates_with_mcp, fetch_web_page_with_mcp, slack_post_message; tools=search_web_candidates_with_mcp, fetch_web_page_with_mcp, slack_post_message\n- MainAgent: coordination, replanning, user-clarification routing\n\nConversation context (recent turns):\nuser: 슬랙 agentic 채널에 프롬프트 인젝션 관련 논문 하나 찾아서 올려줘\n\nOriginal user request:\n슬랙 agentic 채널에 프롬프트 인젝션 관련 논문 하나 찾아서 올려줘\n\nShared progress context:\nPrevious step outputs:\n(none)\n\nOpen additional needs:\n(none)\n\nCurrent remaining planned steps:\n1. PaperAnalyst - Post the found paper to the 'agentic' Slack channel. Format the message appropriately, including the paper's title and a link. (tool_hints: slack_post_message)\n\nOutput format:\n1) Main response for this step.\n2) Additional needs under heading 'Additional Needs:'.\n   - If none: `Additional Needs: none`\n   - If needed, use bullets with target prefix:\n     - [TargetAgentName] concrete request\n   - TargetAgentName must be one of the available agents listed above."
