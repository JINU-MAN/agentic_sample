President Trump urged the Mexican government to \\\"step up their effort on Cartels and Drugs!\\\" after Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, known as \\\"El Mencho,\\\" was killed on Sunday. Mexico's president said cartel roadblocks had been cleared from Mexico's highways and that flights would resume in a few days.

Eve Chen Travelers with imminent plans to vacation in Mexico may want to pause, Mike Ballard, director of intelligence at security firm Global Guardian, told USA TODAY. While resort areas and hotels have been \\\"relatively spared from the impact,\\\" he said, people should reconsider their travel plans to Puerto Vallarta or Cancun in the next 48 hours. \\\"We don’t know exactly how this is going to continue to play out. It could get worse, it could get better,\\\" Ballard said. Jason Hanson, former CIA officer and author of “Spy Secrets That Can Save Your Life,” put it more bluntly: “Do not go to Mexico.” “I do a lot of security consulting, a lot of travel, and I’ve told people this for the last decade: Do not go to Mexico,” he said. “It is way too volatile, way too dangerous. … Your life is too precious. Your security’s too precious.

The cartel produced a similar nationwide show of force in 2015, even using a rocket-propelled grenade to shoot down a Mexican army helicopter, after the Mexican military tried to capture Oseguera Cervantes, more commonly known as \\\"El Mencho.\\\" “If past is prologue, what we've seen is that there will be at least a week, maybe more, of these sort of violent reprisals by the cartels.
