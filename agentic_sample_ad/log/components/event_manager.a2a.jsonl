It provides a good overview of BERT, including its architecture, training, and history.\nI have also fetched the GeeksforGeeks article. It explains the architecture, working, and applications of BERT, with a focus on the Masked Language Model (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) training strategies.\n\nHere's a summary of the findings:\n\n*   **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** is a language model introduced by Google in 2018. (Wikipedia, GeeksforGeeks, Snowflake)\n*   It uses a transformer-based neural network to understand and generate human-like language. (GeeksforGeeks)\n*   BERT employs an encoder-only architecture.

(GeeksforGeeks)\n*   Key training strategies include Masked Language Model (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP).

I will use `search_web_candidates_with_mcp` to search for these.\nThe search results are not very relevant. It seems like focusing on \"BERT\" is bringing in too much noise from other uses of the word. I will try a more specific search focusing on transformer architecture and language models in the context of Google.\nStill getting a lot of general results. It seems a direct search for \"academic paper\" is not effective. I will try searching for specific components of BERT architecture, combined with \"paper\".\nThese results are still not ideal. The issue might be that explicitly searching for \"paper\" is too restrictive and returning irrelevant results. I will try a broader search for technical explanations of BERT components and then use PaperAnalyst to check if the results are academic papers.\nThe same irrelevant results keep appearing. It seems like web search is struggling to provide the desired academic rigor. Given the limited tool usage, I'll request PaperAnalyst to investigate based on the components.\n\nAdditional Needs:\n- [PaperAnalyst] Find academic papers explaining BERT's masked language model, next sentence prediction, and transformer encoder.\n\n[Step 5 - PaperAnalyst]\nOkay, I will find academic papers explaining BERT's masked language model, next sentence prediction, and transformer encoder using the `scrape_papers_with_mcp` tool.\nThe papers found are not directly relevant to BERT's masked language model, next sentence prediction, and transformer encoder. They mention some of the keywords but are about different topics like AI Agents, security analysis, and network traffic classification.

Flights to and from Puerto Vallarta were suspended, leaving tourists stranded. Airports are mostly returning to normal operations.\\n*   **Government Response**: The Mexican government deployed additional troops to affected areas and stated that they are working to restore order.\\n*   **US Involvement**: The US provided intelligence for the operation that led to El Mencho's death, and U.S. officials described him as one of the most ruthless drug kingpins. The US State Department fielded hundreds of calls from stranded travelers.\\n*   **Security Concerns**: Security experts suggest the violence could continue for days or weeks.

I'll limit the number of characters fetched to stay within the tool's limits.\\nBased on the fetched content:\\n\\n*   **AP News:** Provides general news and updates about Mexico. (https://apnews.com/hub/mexico)\\n*   **Al Jazeera:** Reports that Mexican officials said 25 soldiers were killed in clashes following a cartel raid. Also reports on violence following the killing of a drug lord named \\\"El Mencho\\\" and mentions Claudia Sheinbaum declining an invitation from Donald Trump. (https://www.aljazeera.com/where/mexico/)\\n*   **Reuters:** The page could not be accessed due to a 401 error.\\n*   **BBC:** The page could not be accessed due to a 404 error.\\n\\nIt appears that recent events include clashes between the military and cartels, as well as violence following the killing of a drug lord. There are also reports of political developments involving President Claudia Sheinbaum. It seems some of the information is outdated, referencing events from February 2026, which is in the future.\\n\\nSince some of the information appears to be future dated, I'll perform another search, this time narrowing the queries to the past week to get more accurate, up-to-date information.\\nThe search results from the past week seem to be dominated by \\\"Daz 3D,\\\" which is irrelevant. I need to refine my search strategy. It's possible that using \\\"last week\\\" is too restrictive and returning irrelevant results. I will try searching for \\\"Mexico current events June 2024\\\" to see if I can get more targeted results.\\nIt seems like my search terms are consistently returning irrelevant results. I will try more generic terms and check more results per query.\\nOkay, this search provides more relevant results, although some are still outdated (February 2026). The main events seem to be related to violence following the killing of a cartel leader named \\\"El Mencho.\\\"\\n\\nBased on the search results, here is a summary of the current situation in Mexico:\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n\\nRecent reports indicate heightened security concerns and violence in several Mexican states following the killing of a powerful cartel leader, \\\"El Mencho.\\\" The Mexican military was involved in the operation that led to his death.

SNS 및 커뮤니티 시그널 분석\n*   **공식적인 논의 부재:** X(Twitter) 및 Reddit 내 'OpenClaw security' 또는 'CVE-2026-25253' 키워드에 대한 유기적인 포스팅이 발견되지 않았습니다.\n*   **원인 추정:** \n    *   **신규 취약점 또는 미래 시나리오:** 보고된 CVE-2026-25253의 연도 표기(2026)와 기업들의 차단 시점(2026년 2월)으로 미루어 볼 때, 이는 매우 최근에 발표된 제로데이 공격이거나 특정 보안 시뮬레이션 시나리오일 가능성이 높습니다.\n    *   **내부 보안 중심 논의:** 일반 대중보다는 기업 보안팀(CISO)이나 인프라 운영팀 내부 채널(Private Slack, 폐쇄형 포럼 등)을 중심으로 긴급 조치가 이루어지고 있어 공용 SNS로의 확산이 지연되고 있는 것으로 보입니다.\n\n#### 2. 예상되는 커뮤니티 반응 및 잠재적 리스크\n*   **개발자 신뢰도 급락:** 1,000개 이상의 악성 스킬이 유통된 '클로허브(ClawHub)' 공급망 공격의 규모로 인해, 오픈소스 AI 에이전트 마켓플레이스 전반에 대한 불신이 확산될 것으로 예상됩니다.\n*   **기업용 AI 비서 도입 위축:** 네이버, 카카오 등 국내 빅테크 기업들의 선제적 차단 조치가 알려지면서, 다른 기업들도 유사한 '에이전트 차단(Agent-Ban)' 정책을 검토할 가능성이 큽니다.\n*   **Shadow AI 리스크:** 공식적인 차단 조치에도 불구하고 개인적으로 오픈클로를 사용하는 개발자들에 대한 내부 감사 및 보안 교육 강화 필요성이 제기될 것입니다.\n\n#### 3. 소셜 미디어 모니터링 결론\n현재 오픈클로 관련 보안 이슈는 **공식적인 뉴스 보도와 기업의 선제적 대응 단계**에 머물러 있으며, 일반 사용자의 SNS 바이럴 단계로는 진입하지 않은 상태입니다. 보안 담당자는 SNS의 반응보다는 앞서 보고된 **공식 가이드(2026.1.29 버전 업데이트 및 API 키 재발급)**에 따라 즉각적인 기술적 조치를 취할 것을 권고합니다.\n\n---\n**Additional Needs:**\n- [MainAgent] 위 SNS 분석 결과와 이전 단계의 뉴스 요약본을 통합하여 슬랙 'agentic' 채널에 최종 보안 리포트 형식으로 게시해 주세요.
