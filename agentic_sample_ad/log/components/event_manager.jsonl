Flights to and from Puerto Vallarta were suspended, leaving tourists stranded. Airports are mostly returning to normal operations.\n*   **Government Response**: The Mexican government deployed additional troops to affected areas and stated that they are working to restore order.\n*   **US Involvement**: The US provided intelligence for the operation that led to El Mencho's death, and U.S. officials described him as one of the most ruthless drug kingpins. The US State Department fielded hundreds of calls from stranded travelers.\n*   **Security Concerns**: Security experts suggest the violence could continue for days or weeks. There are concerns about the potential for increased cartel activity in other Latin American countries.\n\nAdditional Notes: The situation is still developing, and the information is based on initial reports.\n\n[MainAgent] Post this result to Slack with the title \"Summary of Recent Events in Mexico\" and include the list of URLs used in the summary.\nAdditional Needs: none", "raw_a2a_result": {"id": "a7051a72-8b5b-4c62-9c95-4bfa0ff43b88", "jsonrpc": "2.0", "result": {"kind": "message", "messageId": "bb12cdbfa4ee4676a263723d6689de9d", "parts": ["<max_depth_reached>"], "role": "agent"}}, "workflow_step": 2, "goal": "Fetch the content of the identified URLs and summarize the key events and developments, focusing on providing a concise and comprehensive overview of the current situation in Mexico.", "tool_hints": ["fetch_web_page_with_mcp", "web_summary"], "parsed_additional_needs": []}, {"ok": true, "agent": "SocialMediaAnalyst", "response": "Okay, I will collect and summarize social signals related to the situation in Mexico.

It seems some of the information is outdated, referencing events from February 2026, which is in the future.\n\nSince some of the information appears to be future dated, I'll perform another search, this time narrowing the queries to the past week to get more accurate, up-to-date information.\nThe search results from the past week seem to be dominated by \"Daz 3D,\" which is irrelevant.
