The article aims to explore the architecture, working and applications of BERT. Illustration of BERT Model Use Case What is BERT? BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) leverages a transformer-based neural network to understand and generate human-like language. BERT employs an encoder-only architecture. In the original Transformer architecture , there are both encoder and decoder modules. The decision to use an encoder-only architecture in BERT suggests a primary emphasis on understanding input sequences rather than generating output sequences. Traditional language models process text sequentially, either from left to right or right to left. This method limits the model's awareness to the immediate context preceding the target word. BERT uses a bi-directional approach considering both the left and right context of words in a sentence, instead of analyzing the text sequentially, BERT looks at all the words in a sentence simultaneously. Pre-training BERT Model The BERT model undergoes Pre-training on Large amounts of unlabeled text to learn contextual embeddings. BERT is pre-trained on large amount of unlabeled text data. The model learns contextual embeddings, which are the representations of words that take into account their surrounding context in a sentence. BERT engages in various unsupervised pre-training tasks. For instance, it might learn to predict missing words in a sentence (Masked Language Model or MLM task), understand the relationship between two sentences, or predict the next sentence in a pair. Workflow of BERT BERT is designed to generate a language model so, only the encoder mechanism is used. Sequence of tokens are fed to the Transformer encoder. These tokens are first embedded into vectors and then processed in the neural network. The output is a sequence of vectors, each corresponding to an input token, providing contextualized representations. When training language models, defining a prediction goal is a challenge. Many models predict the next word in a sequence, which is a directional approach and may limit context learning. BERT Model Working BERT addresses this challenge with two innovative training strategies: Masked Language Model (MLM) Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) 1. Masked Language Model (MLM) In BERT's pre-training process, a portion of words in each input sequence is masked and the model is trained to predict the original values of these masked words based on the context provided by the surrounding words. BERT adds a classification layer on top of the output from the encoder. This layer is important for predicting the masked words. The output vectors from the classification layer are multiplied by the embedding matrix, transforming them into the vocabulary dimension. This step helps align the predicted representations with the vocabulary space. The probability of each word in the vocabulary is calculated using the SoftMax activation function . This step generates a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary for each masked position. The loss function used during training considers only the prediction of the masked values. The model is penalized for the deviation between its predictions and the actual values of the masked words. The model converges slower than directional models because during training, BERT is only concerned with predicting the masked values, ignoring the prediction of the non-masked words. The increased context awareness achieved through this strategy compensates for the slower convergence. 2. Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) BERT predicts if the second sentence is connected to the first. This is done by transforming the output of the [CLS] token into a 2×1 shaped vector using a classification layer, and then calculating the probability of whether the second sentence follows the first using SoftMax. In the training process, BERT learns to understand the relationship between pairs of sentences, predicting if the second sentence follows the first in the original document. 50% of the input pairs have the second sentence as the subsequent sentence in the original document, and the other 50% have a randomly chosen sentence. To help the model distinguish between connected and disconnected sentence pairs. The input is processed before entering the model. BERT predicts if the second sentence is connected to the first. This is done by transforming the output of the [CLS] token into a 2×1 shaped vector using a classification layer, and then calculating the probability of whether the second sentence follows the first using SoftMax. During the training of BERT model, the Masked LM and Next Sentence Prediction are trained together. The model aims to minimize the combined loss function of the Masked LM and Next Sentence Prediction, leading to a robust language model with enhanced capabilities in understanding context within sentences and relationships between sentences. Why to train Masked LM and Next Sentence Prediction together? Masked LM helps BERT to understand the context within a sentence and Next Sentence Prediction helps BERT grasp the connection or relationship between pairs of sentences. Hence, training both the strategies together ensures that BERT learns a broad and comprehensive understanding of language, capturing both details within sentences and the flow between sentences.

Embedding : This module converts the sequence of tokens into an array of real-valued vectors representing the tokens. It represents the conversion of discrete token types into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space . Encoder: a stack of Transformer blocks with self-attention , but without causal masking.

Token type: The token type is a standard embedding layer, translating a one-hot vector into a dense vector based on its token type. Position: The position embeddings are based on a token's position in the sequence. BERT uses absolute position embeddings, where each position in a sequence is mapped to a real-valued vector. Each dimension of the vector consists of a sinusoidal function that takes the position in the sequence as input. Segment type: Using a vocabulary of just 0 or 1, this embedding layer produces a dense vector based on whether the token belongs to the first or second text segment in that input.

Position: The position embeddings are based on a token's position in the sequence. BERT uses absolute position embeddings, where each position in a sequence is mapped to a real-valued vector. Each dimension of the vector consists of a sinusoidal function that takes the position in the sequence as input. Segment type: Using a vocabulary of just 0 or 1, this embedding layer produces a dense vector based on whether the token belongs to the first or second text segment in that input. In other words, type-1 tokens are all tokens that appear after the [SEP] special token. All prior tokens are type-0. The three embedding vectors are added together representing the initial token representation as a function of these three pieces of inf", "truncated": true, "content_length": 47930}}, "isError": false}}}

The article aims to explore the architecture, working and applications of BERT. Illustration of BERT Model Use Case What is BERT? BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) leverages a transformer-based neural network to understand and generate human-like language. BERT employs an encoder-only architecture. In the original Transformer architecture , there are both encoder and decoder modules. The decision to use an encoder-only architecture in BERT suggests a primary emphasis on understanding input sequences rather than generating output sequences. Traditional language models process text sequentially, either from left to right or right to left. This method limits the model's awareness to the immediate context preceding the target word. BERT uses a bi-directional approach considering both the left and right context of words in a sentence, instead of analyzing the text sequentially, BERT looks at all the words in a sentence simultaneously. Pre-training BERT Model The BERT model undergoes Pre-training on Large amounts of unlabeled text to learn contextual embeddings. BERT is pre-trained on large amount of unlabeled text data. The model learns contextual embeddings, which are the representations of words that take into account their surrounding context in a sentence. BERT engages in various unsupervised pre-training tasks. For instance, it might learn to predict missing words in a sentence (Masked Language Model or MLM task), understand the relationship between two sentences, or predict the next sentence in a pair. Workflow of BERT BERT is designed to generate a language model so, only the encoder mechanism is used. Sequence of tokens are fed to the Transformer encoder. These tokens are first embedded into vectors and then processed in the neural network. The output is a sequence of vectors, each corresponding to an input token, providing contextualized representations. When training language models, defining a prediction goal is a challenge. Many models predict the next word in a sequence, which is a directional approach and may limit context learning. BERT Model Working BERT addresses this challenge with two innovative training strategies: Masked Language Model (MLM) Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) 1. Masked Language Model (MLM) In BERT's pre-training process, a portion of words in each input sequence is masked and the model is trained to predict the original values of these masked words based on the context provided by the surrounding words. BERT adds a classification layer on top of the output from the encoder. This layer is important for predicting the masked words. The output vectors from the classification layer are multiplied by the embedding matrix, transforming them into the vocabulary dimension. This step helps align the predicted representations with the vocabulary space. The probability of each word in the vocabulary is calculated using the SoftMax activation function . This step generates a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary for each masked position. The loss function used during training considers only the prediction of the masked values. The model is penalized for the deviation between its predictions and the actual values of the masked words. The model converges slower than directional models because during training, BERT is only concerned with predicting the masked values, ignoring the prediction of the non-masked words. The increased context awareness achieved through this strategy compensates for the slower convergence. 2. Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) BERT predicts if the second sentence is connected to the first. This is done by transforming the output of the [CLS] token into a 2×1 shaped vector using a classification layer, and then calculating the probability of whether the second sentence follows the first using SoftMax. In the training process, BERT learns to understand the relationship between pairs of sentences, predicting if the second sentence follows the first in the original document. 50% of the input pairs have the second sentence as the subsequent sentence in the original document, and the other 50% have a randomly chosen sentence. To help the model distinguish between connected and disconnected sentence pairs. The input is processed before entering the model. BERT predicts if the second sentence is connected to the first. This is done by transforming the output of the [CLS] token into a 2×1 shaped vector using a classification layer, and then calculating the probability of whether the second sentence follows the first using SoftMax. During the training of BERT model, the Masked LM and Next Sentence Prediction are trained together. The model aims to minimize the combined loss function of the Masked LM and Next Sentence Prediction, leading to a robust language model with enhanced capabilities in understanding context within sentences and relationships between sentences. Why to train Masked LM and Next Sentence Prediction together? Masked LM helps BERT to understand the context within a sentence and Next Sentence Prediction helps BERT grasp the connection or relationship between pairs of sentences. Hence, training both the strategies together ensures that BERT learns a broad and comprehensive understanding of language, capturing both details within sentences and the flow between sentences.

This \nreview critically distinguishes between AI Agents and Agentic AI, offering a structured, conceptual taxonomy, \napplication mapping, and analysis of opportunities and challenges to clarify their divergent design philosophies \nand capabilities. We begin by outlining the search strategy and foundational definitions, characterizing AI \nAgents as modular systems driven and enabled by LLMs and LIMs for task-specific automation. Generative \nAI is positioned as a precursor providing the foundation, with AI agents advancing through tool integration, \nprompt engineering, and reasoning enhancements. We then characterize Agentic AI systems, which, in contrast \nto AI Agents, represent a paradigm shift marked by multi-agent collaboration, dynamic task decomposition, \npersistent memory, and coordinated autonomy. Through a chronological evaluation of architectural evolution, \noperational mechanisms, interaction styles, and autonomy levels, we present a comparative analysis across \nboth AI agents and agentic AI paradigms. Application domains enabled by AI Agents such as customer \nsupport, scheduling, and data summarization are then contrasted with Agentic AI deployments in research \nautomation, robotic coordination, and medical decision support. We further examine unique challenges in \neach paradigm including hallucination, brittleness, emergent behavior, and coordination failure, and propose \ntargeted solutions such as ReAct loops, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), automation coordination layers, \nand causal modeling. This work aims to provide a roadmap for developing robust, scalable, and explainable \nAI-driven systems.\n1. Introduction\nPrior to the widespread adoption of AI Agents and Agentic AI \n(Fig.  1) around 2022 (Before ChatGPT was introduced), the devel-\nopment of autonomous and intelligent agents was deeply rooted in \nfoundational paradigms of artificial intelligence, particularly multi-\nagent systems (MAS) and expert systems, which emphasized social \naction and distributed intelligence [1,2]. Notably, Castelfranchi [3] \nlaid the critical groundwork by introducing ontological categories for \nsocial action, structure, and mind, arguing that sociality emerges from \nindividual agents’ actions and cognitive processes in a shared environ-\nment, with concepts like goal delegation and adoption forming the basis \nfor cooperation and organizational behavior. Similarly, Ferber [4] pro-\nvided a comprehensive framework for MAS, defining agents as entities \nwith autonomy, perception, and communication capabilities, and high-\nlighting their applications in distributed problem-solving, collaborative \nrobotics, and synthetic world simulations.\n∗ Corresponding authors.\nE-mail addresses: rs2672@cornell.edu (R. Sapkota), mk2684@cornell.edu (M. Karkee).\nThese early studies established that individual social actions and \ncognitive architectures are fundamental to modeling collective phe-\nnomena, setting the stage for modern AI Agents. This paper builds on \nthese foundational concepts to explore how social action modeling, as \nproposed in [3,4], informs the design of AI Agents capable of complex, \nsocially intelligent interactions in dynamic environments.\nClassical Agent-like systems were designed to perform specific tasks \nwith predefined rules, which offered limited autonomy, and minimal \nadaptability to dynamic environments. These systems were primar-\nily reactive or deliberative, relying on symbolic reasoning, rule-based \nlogic, or scripted behaviors rather than the learning-driven, context-\naware capabilities of modern AI Agents [5,6]. For instance, expert \nsystems used knowledge bases and inference engines to emulate human \ndecision-making in domains like medical diagnosis (e.g., MYCIN [7]). \nOther notable examples include DENDRAL [8], an expert system for \nmolecular structure prediction; XCON [9], used for computer system \nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.inffus.2025.103599\nReceived 29 May 2025; Received in revised form 25 July 2025; Accepted 30 July 2025\nInformation Fusion 126 (2026) 103599 \nAvailable online 22 August 2025 \n1566-2535/© 2025 The Authors.

These intelligent agents, ca-\npable of reasoning, planning, delegating, and executing complex workflows,\nnow form the backbone of applications ranging from supply chain coordi-\nnation to personalized financial assistance. As the scale and complexity of\nmulti-agent ecosystems increase, so too do the requirements for secure, in-\nteroperable communication protocols.\nCommunication between autonomous agents introduces unique security\nchallenges. Unlike traditional client-server architectures, agent-based sys-\ntems must manage peer-to-peer trust, dynamic task delegation, and sensi-\ntive data sharing across heterogeneous actors. In such environments, the risk\nof credential leakage, overprivileged access, prompt injection, and unverified\nexecution grows exponentially [2, 3]. Standard security frameworks such as\nOAuth 2.0 and TLS, while foundational, do not provide sufficient granular-\nity or contextual awareness for these interactions, especially in cases where\nagents dynamically compose tasks involving payments, identity verification,\nor confidential documents [4, 5].\nTo address these gaps, several agent communication protocols have been\ndeveloped, each offering a different perspective on interoperability, trust man-\nagement, and delegation control [6]. Google’sAgent-to-Agent (A2A)protocol\n[7] introduces a declarative model for service discovery. TheAgent Commu-\nnication Protocol (ACP)[8] embraces flexibility with a registry-based model.\nTheCORAL[9] framework, in contrast, proposes a hybrid architecture inte-\ngrating on-chain smart contracts for payments with off-chain communication.\n•Google’sAgent-to-Agent (A2A)protocol [7] introduces a declarative\nmodel for service discovery.\n•TheAgent Communication Protocol (ACP)[8] embraces flexibility with\na registry-based model.\n•TheCORAL[9] framework, in contrast, proposes a hybrid architec-\nture integrating on-chain smart contracts for payments with off-chain\ncommunication.\nWhile these protocols present promising architectures, their security prop-\nerties are discussed in the literature but rarely subjected to comparative\nempirical testing [2]. This study fills this gap by providing a detailed, multi-\ndimensional security analysis and empirical testing. We establish a 14-point\n2 vulnerability taxonomy (Section 6), derived from literature and threat mod-\neling.\nOur findings reveal a critical ”architecture versus implementation” di-\nchotomy. We demonstrate that CORAL, while possessing a robust architec-\nture for integrating payments and securing data integrity via transport-layer\nvalidation, is critically vulnerable in its current public implementation due\nto fundamental authentication and authorization failures at its SSE gateway.\nConversely, our tests confirm that ACP’s architectural flexibility is, in itself,\na vulnerability, leading to predictable integrity failures and data exfiltra-\ntion in non-strict configurations.

The current best practice would be to check if\neach data includes any suspicious signatures, or simply strings,\nwhich were obtained a priori by elaborate manual analysis\nin previous cyberattack cases. Unfortunately, unknown at-\ntacks, called zero-day attacks, cannot be timely detected in\nthis way because no signature is available yet. To tackle this\nproblem, recent studies have presented high-speed methods\nthat can extract frequent substrings from the data stream and\nuse them as attack signatures because the frequently-occurred\nsignatures are often related with attacks; unfortunately, more\nbenign signatures are extracted than malicious ones, espe-\ncially when there is no attack in most of the time. This causes\nboth a tremendous number of false-positives and extra human\ninterventions to remove benign signatures. In this paper, we\ndesign a new streaming algorithm that can ﬁrst identify a\nfrequent group of signatures appearing together at the same\ntime from data streams. Using this frequent signature-group\ninstead of frequently-occurred individual signatures, the new\nscheme achieves a high detection accuracy by mitigating the\nfalse-positive problem with only a small ﬁxed amount of\nmemory and a constant number of hash operations, which has\nnot been achieved by any previous work. This improvement\ncomes from a new method for summarizing similar data with\na ﬁxed amount of memory, called a minHashed virtual vector,\nwhich allows us to automatically identify a frequent group\nof signatures with each data read only once. We perform ex-\nhaustive experiments on different private and open datasets,\nto verify both the practical effectiveness and the experimental\nreproducibility of the new scheme.\n1 Introduction\nOne of the most important tasks in cybersecurity is to collect\nand analyze data that come from a range of security products,\nnetworking components, servers, and even user endpoints.\nThe data can be security events or alerts triggered by moni-\ntoring devices, network packets, emails, suspicious ﬁles, etc.,\nwhich are continuously generated. These data are often col-\nlected by a security operations center (SOC) where security\nanalysts work for real-time monitoring and manual analysis\nfor critical data [ 10, 25, 30, 56]. Recent studies reveal that\nsecurity alerts overwhelm human resources by their large vol-\numes [10, 16, 25, 30, 45, 56]. For example, more than million\nalerts are generated per day while only dozens of people work\nfor alert analysis at best. Therefore, intelligent and automatic\ndata analysis tools are essential for this industry.\nAttack detection still relies on signature matching after a\nsignature, a simple string or a regular expression, is manually\nwritten by experts. The problem is that attackers use more\nzero-day attacks, vulnerabilities and exploits only known to at-\ntackers [61], and the signature-based detection may not effec-\ntively mitigate the attacks any longer. This motivates a lot of\nmachine learning (ML) approaches for anomaly detection in\ncybersecurity. However, ML inherently causes false-positives,\nnon-attacks mistakenly considered as attacks [ 50].

Covers RBAC, Pod Security Standards, Network Policies, secrets management, cluster hardening, and compliance.

A single misconfiguration or oversight in any of these layers can expose your entire infrastructure to severe security incidents including unauthorized data access where attackers read sensitive customer information or proprietary business data, privilege escalation where attackers gain cluster-admin rights and take complete control of the cluster, lateral movement where compromised containers access other pods, databases, or cloud resources they shouldn't reach, data exfiltration where attackers steal databases or secrets and transmit them externally, cryptomining where attackers deploy resource-intensive cryptocurrency miners consuming your cloud budget, ransomware attacks encrypting persistent volumes and demanding payment, supply chain attacks through compromised base images or malicious dependencies, and compliance violations resulting in regulatory fines, failed audits, loss of certifications, and reputational damage that drives customers away. The challenge is that Kubernetes security isn't a single toggle or configuration it requires implementing dozens of interconnected controls across multiple dimensions. You can have perfect RBAC preventing unauthorized human access, but if you allow privileged containers, attackers can escape containers and compromise nodes. You can lock down pod security, but if network policies aren't implemented, compromised pods can scan and attack other services across your cluster. You can secure the cluster itself, but if you pull untrusted container images without vulnerability scanning, you deploy pre-compromised applications directly into production. This comprehensive Kubernetes security checklist provides 50 actionable, production-tested security practices organized into logical categories, based on official security frameworks including the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark (industry-standard security configuration guide), NSA and CISA Kubernetes Hardening Guide (government security guidance), Kubernetes Security documentation and CVE analysis, and real-world production security incidents and lessons learned from breaches. Each practice includes clear implementation instructions, explains why it matters with real attack scenarios, provides ready-to-use YAML configurations or kubectl commands, and indicates compliance frameworks it addresses (CIS, SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS). We'll also demonstrate how Atmosly automates the implementation of many of these security controls, continuously monitors for violations, and provides compliance reporting showing which practices are implemented versus missing across your clusters. By methodically implementing these 50 practices, you'll establish defense-in-depth security posture for your Kubernetes infrastructure, dramatically reduce attack surface and risk exposure, meet regulatory compliance requirements with auditable controls, prevent the most common Kubernetes security incidents that plague improperly secured clusters, and gain security confidence enabling your organization to move faster with Kubernetes while maintaining strong security rather than treating security and velocity as opposing forces. Category 1: Access Control & Authentication (Practices 1-10) Practice 1: Enable RBAC Authorization Implementation: Ensure Kubernetes API server runs with --authorization-mode=RBAC (default in Kubernetes 1.6+) Verification: # Check RBAC is enabled kubectl api-versions | grep rbac # Should show: # rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 Why it matters: RBAC is the foundation of Kubernetes security. Without it, you have no access control anyone who can authenticate can do anything. This is the most critical security control. Compliance: Required by CIS 3.1.1, SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS Practice 2: Disable Anonymous Authentication Implementation: Set --anonymous-auth=false on API server Why it matters: Anonymous auth allows unauthenticated requests to API server with default permissions. This creates unnecessary attack surface. All requests should require authentication. Verification: # Try anonymous request (should fail) curl -k https://CLUSTER_IP:6443/api/v1/namespaces # Should return 401 Unauthorized if anonymous auth disabled Compliance: CIS 1.2.1, NSA/CISA Hardening Guide Practice 3: Implement Strong Authentication (OIDC/LDAP) Implementation: Configure OIDC or LDAP instead of static client certificates # API server OIDC flags --oidc-issuer-url=https://accounts.google.com --oidc-client-id=kubernetes --oidc-username-claim=email --oidc-groups-claim=groups Why it matters: Client certificates don't expire, can't be revoked easily, and lack MFA support.

Verification: # Try anonymous request (should fail) curl -k https://CLUSTER_IP:6443/api/v1/namespaces # Should return 401 Unauthorized if anonymous auth disabled Compliance: CIS 1.2.1, NSA/CISA Hardening Guide Practice 3: Implement Strong Authentication (OIDC/LDAP) Implementation: Configure OIDC or LDAP instead of static client certificates # API server OIDC flags --oidc-issuer-url=https://accounts.google.com --oidc-client-id=kubernetes --oidc-username-claim=email --oidc-groups-claim=groups Why it matters: Client certificates don't expire, can't be revoked easily, and lack MFA support.

Discover top considerations and a roadmap to strengthen your cloud defenses. Download the Guide Now Kubernetes is the undisputed industry standard for container orchestration, and its rise is closely tied to the wide adoption of cloud-native technologies. However, as security breaches continue to increase globally, it’s necessary to institute and adhere to security best practices across your Kubernetes clusters — whether they’re on-premises or in the public cloud. In this article, we’ll provide an overview of key recommendations for Kubernetes security best practices. These practices are based on the 4 Cs, which are designed to help organizations achieve optimal security across the primary layers of typical Kubernetes environments. The 4 Cs of Kubernetes security The Kubernetes platform played a part in bridging development and operations teams into the role now known as DevOps. Thus, when discussing Kubernetes security, it is essential to consider both the application and infrastructure aspects. The 4 Cs security framework thoroughly addresses security principles across all four layers through which Kubernetes operates. Code: Application code must be written according to rigorous code security standards and should follow standard application security guidelines, such as the OWASP Top Ten . Container: The smallest unit of work inside any Kubernetes cluster is a pod, which contains one or many containers running inside the same local network. Each container running inside any pod in production must use a trustworthy base image and runtime environment. Cluster: This layer refers directly to how Kubernetes itself is configured. The access policies and security configurations of every Kubernetes cluster must be carefully designed. Cloud: Like any other piece of software, Kubernetes ultimately runs on underlying hardware. The cloud infrastructure that hosts Kubernetes must be properly protected from attacks. The Complete Guide to CNAPPs Download CrowdStrike's Complete Guide to CNAPPs to understand why Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms are a critical component of modern cloud security strategies and how to best integrate them to development lifecycles. Download Now Code security Code reviews Application code security is often neglected as deadlines for releasing a feature approach. No matter how urgent a release seems, security should ideally be part of the acceptance criteria of any new feature. Code reviews ought to consider security aspects with a high degree of importance. Multiple developers should participate in the code review process to ensure that applications adhere to security standards as much as they do general coding standards. Automated vulnerability scanning tools Every software project depends on a number of third-party libraries. These dependencies save time and allow developers to focus on the business logic of the application instead of generic problems that have already been solved. However, as with any other piece of software, these libraries can contain security vulnerabilities. Therefore, continuously scanning third-party dependencies for vulnerabilities and patching them before your application is released to production should be integrated into the continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline as part of the build process. Container security Deploy trusted images Container images that support your application are built on top of a base image , which often contains dependencies of its own. To ensure the highest levels of container security, it is recommended to use the leanest possible base image (with fewer dependencies when possible, since each dependency is a vector for potential security vulnerabilities). Nevertheless, it isn’t realistic to shy away from such dependencies, so the use of trusted images becomes essential. Ideally, only images from verified sources should be used. These sources include Docker Official Images and the Docker Verified Publisher Program . Regularly scan images and monitor runtime behavior As with application dependencies, scan your images before deploying them to a container registry. Kubernetes will pull these images and use them for deployment. But even after deployment, container runtimes should be continuously monitored to detect potential anomalies caused by malware or unauthorized access. Cluster security Implement RBAC Cluster security can be split into several domains that must be carefully addressed. Access control should be granularly controlled with role-based access control (RBAC) so that only necessary privileges are granted to cluster operators.

Authorities said Monday that 25 members of the National Guard were killed in Jalisco in six separate attacks. Mexican security forces killed Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, also known as \\\"El Mencho,\\\" during an operation in the western state of Jalisco, Mexico's Ministry of Defense said . It said he was wounded during the raid in the town of Tapalpa and died while being flown to Mexico City. The state of Jalisco is the base of the cartel known for trafficking huge quantities of fentanyl and other drugs to the United States. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, who also confirmed the cartel leader's death, described him as \\\"one of the bloodiest and most ruthless drug kingpins.\\\" \\\"This is a great development for Mexico, the US, Latin America, and the world. The good guys are stronger than the bad guys,\\\" Landau said on X. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the U.S. \\\"provided intelligence\\\" for the operation. A U.S. defense official told CBS News the U.S. military played a role in the operation via the Joint Interagency Task Force-Counter Cartel, which regularly works with the Mexican military through the U.S. Northern Command. The official emphasized that \\\"this was a Mexican military operation, so the success is theirs.\\\" According to a source briefed on the operation, the raid was the culmination of intensified U.S.-Mexico counter-cartel cooperation under Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, with intelligence sharing markedly expanded in recent months. No American personnel were on the ground, the source said. President Trump on Monday called on Mexico to boost its efforts targeting drug cartels one day after the military raid. \\\"Mexico must step up their effort on Cartels and Drugs!\\\" Mr. Trump wrote in a social media post. Mike Vigil, former DEA Chief of International Operations, told CBS News that the military operation was \\\"one of the most significant actions undertaken in the history of drug trafficking.\\\" \\\"Because we're talking about someone that is almost at the same level as (Joaquin) \\\"El Chapo\\\" Guzman and (Ismael) \\\"El Mayo\\\" Zambada,\\\" he added. \\\"(Oseguera Cervantes) is one of the biggest drug capos in the history of drug trafficking around the globe.\\\" The U.S. State Department released a security alert advising American citizens in several Mexican states, including Jalisco, Tamaulipas, Michoacan, Guerrero and Nuevo Leon, to shelter in place until further notice. The Department of State Consular Affairs, in a message telling U.S. citizens to continue sheltering in place, said on social media that taxi and rideshare service had been suspended in Puerto Vallarta. During the operation, troops came under fire and killed four people at the location. Three more people, including Oseguera Cervantes, were wounded and later died, the Ministry of Defense's statement said. Two others were arrested and armored vehicles, rocket launchers and other arms were seized. Three members of the armed forces were wounded and are receiving medical treatment. The killing of the powerful drug lord triggered several hours of roadblocks with burning vehicles in Jalisco and other states. Such tactics are commonly used by the cartels to block military operations.

A U.S. defense official told CBS News the U.S. military played a role in the operation via the Joint Interagency Task Force-Counter Cartel, which regularly works with the Mexican military through the U.S. Northern Command. The official emphasized that \"this was a Mexican military operation, so the success is theirs.\" According to a source briefed on the operation, the raid was the culmination of intensified U.S.-Mexico counter-cartel cooperation under Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, with intelligence sharing markedly expanded in recent months. No American personnel were on the ground, the source said. President Trump on Monday called on Mexico to boost its efforts targeting drug cartels one day after the military raid. \"Mexico must step up their effort on Cartels and Drugs!\" Mr. Trump wrote in a social media post. Mike Vigil, former DEA Chief of International Operations, told CBS News that the military operation was \"one of the most significant actions undertaken in the history of drug trafficking.\" \"Because we're talking about someone that is almost at the same level as (Joaquin) \"El Chapo\" Guzman and (Ismael) \"El Mayo\" Zambada,\" he added. \"(Oseguera Cervantes) is one of the biggest drug capos in the history of drug trafficking around the globe.\" The U.S. State Department released a security alert advising American citizens in several Mexican states, including Jalisco, Tamaulipas, Michoacan, Guerrero and Nuevo Leon, to shelter in place until further notice. The Department of State Consular Affairs, in a message telling U.S. citizens to continue sheltering in place, said on social media that taxi and rideshare service had been suspended in Puerto Vallarta. During the operation, troops came under fire and killed four people at the location. Three more people, including Oseguera Cervantes, were wounded and later died, the Ministry of Defense's statement said. Two others were arrested and armored vehicles, rocket launchers and other arms were seized. Three members of the armed forces were wounded and are receiving medical treatment. The killing of the powerful drug lord triggered several hours of roadblocks with burning vehicles in Jalisco and other states. Such tactics are commonly used by the cartels to block military operations. A member of the Prosecutor's Office stands guard near a burning bus set on fire by organized crime groups in response to an operation in Jalisco to arrest a high-priority security target, at one of the main avenues in Zapopan, state of Jalisco, Mexico, on Feb. 22, 2026. Ulises Ruiz /AFP via Getty Images Jalisco Gov. Pablo Lemus Navarro activated a \"code red,\" which is a protocol for a state of emergency or security crisis, in response to the clashes. In a post on X, he said public transportation was suspended across Jalisco and urged people in the area to remain in their homes until the situation was under control. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, on social media , acknowledged the roadblocks but stressed, \"In the vast majority of the national territory, activities are proceeding with complete normality.\" Mexico's security agency said Sunday night there were 252 blockades reported throughout the country, and that by 8 p.m., 23 still hadn't been cleared. There were 65 roadblocks in Jalisco, the most in any single territory, the agency said. Videos circulating on social media showed plumes of smoke billowing over the city of Puerto Vallarta, a major city in Jalisco, and sprinting through the airport of the state's capital in panic. \"They are burning buses, they're shutting down roads, not only in Jalisco", "truncated": true, "content_length": 11723}}, "isError": false}}, "session_seq": 5}

Jason Hanson, former CIA officer and author of “Spy Secrets That Can Save Your Life,” put it more bluntly: “Do not go to Mexico.” “I do a lot of security consulting, a lot of travel, and I’ve told people this for the last decade: Do not go to Mexico,” he said. “It is way too volatile, way too dangerous. … Your life is too precious. Your security’s too precious. There’s a million other beautiful places in this world.” 7:11 pm ET February 23, 2026 Share this update Violence in Mexico could last for days Josh Meyer The public display of violence in Mexico following the slaying of drug lord Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes could continue for a few days or weeks, given his stature within the Jalisco New Generation Cartel and the group's extraordinary military-style capabilities, veteran cartel watchers tell USA TODAY. The cartel produced a similar nationwide show of force in 2015, even using a rocket-propelled grenade to shoot down a Mexican army helicopter, after the Mexican military tried to capture Oseguera Cervantes, more commonly known as \"El Mencho.\" “If past is prologue, what we've seen is that there will be at least a week, maybe more, of these sort of violent reprisals by the cartels.

Contributing by Reuters 6:01 pm ET February 23, 2026 Share this update Most airports in Mexico return to normal operations Francesca Chambers Most airports in Mexico are now operating normally, the State Department said on Monday evening as it narrowed its shelter in place advisory for U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens in Puerto Vallarta and the surrounding areas in Jalisco and Nayarit are still being encouraged to shelter in place \"due to road blockages and criminal activity related\" to the Mexican military raid on Feb. 22. However, the State Department said multiple airlines were operating from Guadalajara and from Puerto Vallarta as of this afternoon. \"Confirm that your flight is on track for departure from Guadalajara or Puerto Vallarta before you depart for the airport,\" it said. 5:37 pm ET February 23, 2026 Share this update US government fields 'hundreds' of calls from stranded travelers Francesca Chambers The State Department says it \"has fielded hundreds of calls\" from travelers in Mexico with \"most pertaining to flight cancellations.\" The call center is operating 24/7, the State Department said. Americans traveling abroad who need assistance can call +1-202-501-4444 from outside the United States or dial +1-888-407-4747 from the United States or Canada. The U.S. government is also encouraging Americans traveling abroad to enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program to receive updates about health, weather, safety, and security at their destinations.

To\nprovide the necessary basis to facilitate the discussion of and\ncomparison among different CDC algorithms, we list below\nsome key properties that a desirable CDC algorithm should\nhave.\n1) Content deﬁned. To avoid the boundaries-shift problem,\nthe algorithm should declare the chunk boundaries based\non local content, i.e., the cut-points for chunking must be\ncontent deﬁned.\n2) Low computational overhead. CDC algorithms need to\ncheck almost every byte in an input data stream to\nﬁnd the chunk boundaries. This means that the algorith-\nm execution time is approximately proportional to the\nnumber of bytes of the input data stream, which can\ntake up signiﬁcant CPU resources. Hence, in order to\nachieve higher deduplication throughput, the chunking\nalgorithm should be simple and devoid of time-consuming\noperations.\n3) Small chunk size variability. The variance of chunk size\nhas a signiﬁcant impact on the deduplication efﬁciency.\nThe smaller the variance of the chunk size is, the higher\nthe deduplication efﬁciency will be achieved [11].\n4) Ability to identify and eliminate low-entropy strings.\nThe content of real data may sometimes include low-\nentropy strings [12]. These strings include very few\ndistinct characters but a large amount of repetitive bytes.\nIn order to achieve higher deduplication efﬁciency, it is\ndesirable for the algorithm to be capable of detecting and\neliminating these duplicate strings.\n5) Less limitations on chunk size. Minimum and maximum\n2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)\n978-1-4799-8381-0/15/$31.00 ©2015 IEEE 1337 thresholds are often imposed on chunk size to avoid\nchunks being too short or too long. These measures\nreduce chunk size variance, but also make the chunk\nboundaries position-dependent and thus not truly content-\ndeﬁned, which also reduces the deduplication efﬁciency\n[13].\nThe Rabin ﬁngerprint [14] based CDC algorithm (Rabin)\nis widely employed for redundancy elimination in both storage\nsystems [15], [2], [16] and networks [5], [17]. The main prob-\nlems of the Rabin algorithm are its low chunking throughput,\nwhich renders the chunking process the performance bottle-\nneck of the deduplication workﬂow [18], [19], and large chunk\nsize variance that lowers the deduplication efﬁciency [11].\nMAXP [20] is a CDC approach that addresses the chunk-size\nvariance problem of Rabin by treating the local extreme values\nas cut-points. Owing to its smaller chunk size variance and\nlower memory overhead than Rabin, MAXP was recommended\nto be used in redundancy elimination in networks [10], [21].\nMAXP slides a ﬁx-sized symmetric window over the byte\nstream on a byte-by-byte basis, and checks whether the value\nof the byte at the center of the current window is the strictly\nextreme value in the window. The byte found to be the extreme\nvalue is declared a cut-point (chunk boundary). This strategy\nof ﬁnding the local maximum values dictates that the MAXP\nalgorithm recheck some previously compared bytes in the\nreverse direction of the stream and thus requires more than one\ncomparison and more than ﬁve conditional branch operations\nper byte scanned [22], which signiﬁcantly lowers its chunking\nthroughput.\nIn other words, while the MAXP algorithm improves\nthe Rabin algorithm by reducing the chunk-size variance,\nthe problem of low chunking throughput remains in both\nalgorithms. To this end, we propose the Asymmetric Extremum\nchunking algorithm (AE), a new CDC algorithm that signiﬁ-\ncantly improves the chunking throughput of the above existing\nalgorithms while providing comparable or better deduplication\nefﬁciency by using the local extreme value in a variable-\nsized asymmetric window to overcome the aforementioned\nboundaries-shift problem. With a variable-sized asymmetric\nwindow, instead of a ﬁx-sized symmetric window as in MAXP ,\nthe AE algorithm ﬁnds the extreme value in the window\nwithout having to backtrack and thus requiring only one\ncomparison and two conditional branch operations p...(truncated)"}}, "isError": false}}, "session_seq": 3510}

OpenClaw 한 문장 정의 2. 핵심 개념(구성요소) 한 번에 이해하기 3. 전체 동작 흐름(메시지가 오면 무슨 일이 벌어지나요?) 4. 시작 흐름(초보자용 체크리스트) 5. 설정(채널/정책) 기초 6. 텔레그램 연결에서 자주 막히는 포인트 7. 스킬(Skills)과 플러그인(Plugins) 8. 메모리(MEMORY.md)와 장기 기억을 안전하게 쓰는 법 9. 자동화: Heartbeat vs Cron 10. 보안/운영 팁(진짜 중요해요!) 11. 트러블슈팅(증상별 빠른 해결) 12. 바로 써먹는 템플릿 “EXFOLIATE! EXFOLIATE!” — A space lobster, probably (탈피하라 ! 탈피하라 ! - openclaw 공식 문구 ㄷㄷㄷ-) 1. OpenClaw 한 문장 정의 OpenClaw, 한 문장으로 말하면 “내 컴퓨터(또는 서버)에서 돌아가는 개인 AI 비서 허브” 예요! (자세한건 지난글 참고!) 텔레그램/디스코드 같은 메신저 에서 메시지가 오면 OpenClaw가 그걸 받아서 LLM(예: OpenAI 계열 모델 등)로 답을 만들고 다시 메신저로 답장을 보내주는 구조라고 보시면 돼요! 포인트 ✨ 단순히 “말만 하는 챗봇”이 아니라, 파일 작업 , 자동화 , 도구 실행 까지 연결해서 정말 “비서처럼” 확장할 수 있게 만들어져 있어요! 2. 핵심 개념(구성요소) 한 번에 이해하기 Gateway(게이트웨이) OpenClaw의 본체 서비스 예요! 채널에서 메시지를 받고, 모델 호출/툴 실행/응답 전송을 담당해요! 쉽게 말하면 “항상 켜져 있는 허브” 느낌입니다 Agent(에이전트) 말투/규칙/도구 접근/워크스페이스 같은 성격과 역할 이 들어있는 단위예요! 한 게이트웨이에서 여러 에이전트를 두는 것도 가능해요! Workspace(워크스페이스) 에이전트가 읽고/쓰고/작업하는 폴더예요! 메모, 문서, 스크립트, 프로젝트 코드 같은 게 여기 들어갑니다! Channel(채널) Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp 같은 “외부 메신저 연결”이에요! 즉 “어디서 말을 걸 수 있냐”를 정해주는 친구죠! Tools(도구) 파일 읽기/쓰기, 쉘 실행 , 브라우저 자동화 같은 “행동” 기능이에요! 설정으로 허용/차단도 가능해서 안전하게 운영할 수 있어요! Skills(스킬) 특정 작업을 잘 하게 해주는 “레시피/패키지”라고 보시면 돼요! 예: 보안 점검 , 특정 채널 연동 같은 것들요! Memory(메모리) 대화/노트에서 중요한 내용을 저장하고, 나중에 검색해서 꺼내 쓰는 기능이에요! 장기 기억처럼 쓰면 정말 편해지는데, 보안 은 꼭 챙겨야 해요! 잠깐만요! (주의) ⚠️ OpenClaw는 “내 컴퓨터에서 돌아가는 서비스”예요! 설정을 잘못하면 누구나 내 비서에게 DM을 보내게(open) 될 수 있어요! 편의성 도 좋지만, 보안 도 같이 잡아주시는 걸 추천드려요! 3. 전체 동작 흐름(메시지가 오면 무슨 일이 벌어지나요?) 흐름은 대충 이렇게 굴러가요! ① 텔레그램에서 사용자가 메시지를 보냄 ② OpenClaw Gateway가 메시지를 수신 ③ (정책 확인) 이 사람/이 채팅에서 응답해도 되는지 체크 ④ 대화 기록 + 시스템 프롬프트 + 필요한 파일/메모리를 조합해 모델에 요청 ⑤ 필요하면 도구 실행(파일 읽기, 웹 조회, 스크립트 실행 등) ⑥ 모델이 최종 답변 생성 ⑦ 텔레그램으로 답변 전송 초보자 꿀팁 😊 “왜 답을 안 하지?”는 대부분 ③번에서 터집니다! 즉 dmPolicy / groupPolicy / allowlist 같은 접근 제어 설정이 원인인 경우가 정말 많아요! 4. 시작 흐름(초보자용 체크리스트) 환경마다 약간 다르긴 한데요, 처음엔 아래 순서로 가시면 마음이 편해요! 4-1) 목표부터 정해볼게요! 어디서 부를 건가요? (예: 텔레그램 DM / 디스코드 서버) 어디까지 하게 할 건가요? (대화만 / 파일 작업 / 자동화) 항상 켜져 있어야 하나요? (PC 상시 / 서버/VPS) 4-2) 텔레그램을 쓰신다면 @BotFather로 봇 생성 Bot Token 확보 봇이 메시지를 받을 수 있는지 확인(차단/프라이버시 설정) 4-3) “켜져 있어야 한다”는 것만 기억해주세요! OpenClaw는 게이트웨이 가 살아 있어야 답장을 해요! PC를 종료하면 당연히 답을 못 하고요! (만약 다른 머신에서 돌아가고 있으면 그쪽이 답할 수도 있어요!) 5. 설정(채널/정책) 기초 OpenClaw는 보통 설정 파일( openclaw.json )에서 “누가 어디서 말을 걸면 답해줄지”를 정해요! 5-1) 텔레그램 DM 정책(dmPolicy) pairing : 페어링된 사용자만 DM 응답 (안전한 기본값 느낌!) allowlist : 허용목록에 있는 사용자만 응답 open : 누구에게나 응답 (편하지만 위험할 수 있어요!) disabled : DM 응답 꺼짐 보안 얘기 조금만 할게요 🙏 open 은 말 그대로 “아무나” DM을 보내도 반응합니다! 도구 실행(쉘 실행 같은 것) 이 열려 있으면 위험도가 확 올라가요! 가능하면 pairing 또는 allowlist 로 시작하시는 걸 추천드려요! 5-2) 그룹 정책(groupPolicy) allowlist : 허용된 그룹에서만 반응 open : 모든 그룹에서 반응 (역시 조심!) disabled : 그룹 응답 꺼짐 5-3) “답변이 안 온다”의 대부분은 정책 문제예요! 봇이 살아 있는데도 무응답이면, 모델 문제가 아니라 “정책상 무응답이 정상”인 경우가 진짜 많습니다 😅 6. 텔레그램 연결에서 자주 막히는 포인트 6-1) 텔레그램에서 ‘대답 안 함’ 체크리스트 게이트웨이가 실행 중인가요? (서비스/프로세스) 봇 토큰이 맞나요? DM 정책이 pairing 인데 페어링을 안 한 건 아닌가요? 그룹이라면 groupPolicy가 allowlist 인데 그룹을 허용하지 않은 건 아닌가요? 봇이 해당 그룹에서 메시지를 받을 수 있는 상태인가요? 추천 운영 방식 👍 처음엔 “DM만” 연결하고, pairing/allowlist 로 제한해서 안정화한 뒤에 그룹이나 고급 도구를 여는 게 제일 안전하고 편해요! 7. 스킬(Skills)과 플러그인(Plugins) 7-1) 스킬(Skills)이 뭐예요? 스킬은 특정 작업을 “잘 하게” 만드는 레시피 묶음이에요! 보안 점검 , 채널 연동 같은 복잡한 작업을 순서대로 수행하도록 도와줍니다! 7-2) 플러그인(Plugins)은요? 텔레그램/디스코드 같은 채널 연결, 인증, 메모리 엔진 확장처럼 기능을 모듈로 추가하는 방식이에요! 정리해드릴게요! 플러그인 = 기능을 추가/확장하는 부품 느낌 스킬 = 그 기능을 이용해서 일을 “잘 되게” 만드는 사용법/레시피 느낌 8. 메모리(MEMORY.md)와 장기 기억을 안전하게 쓰는 법 오래 쓰다 보면 “취향/프로젝트 맥락/자주 하는 작업”을 기억해두면 엄청 편해요! 보통은 이런 식으로 정리합니다! MEMORY.md (장기 요약/정제된 기억) memory/2026-02-12.md (하루 로그/메모) memory/heartbeat-state.json (체크 상태 같은 운영 기록) 중요! 메모리는 ‘보안 경계’예요 🔒 그룹 채팅이나 공개 채널에서 메모리 내용을 그대로 말하면 민감정보 가 새어 나갈 수 있어요! 그래서 보통 개인 대화(메인 세션) 에서만 메모리를 적극 활용하고 공유 채팅에서는 더 조심스럽게 운영합니다! 8-1) 초보자 추천 운영 팁 일일 로그는 raw하게, MEMORY.md는 요약/정제해서 저장해보세요! 비밀번호/토큰 같은 민감정보는 메모리에 넣지 않으시는 걸 추천드려요! “기억해줘”라고 하실 때는 어떤 파일에 기록할지 정해두면 더 안전해요! 9. 자동화: Heartbeat vs Cron 9-1) Heartbeat(하트비트) 하트비트는 “주기적으로 상태를 점검하고, 필요할 때만 알려주는” 방식에 좋아요! 여러 체크를 한 번에 묶어서 처리하기에 딱입니다! 9-2) Cron(정시 알림/정확한 스케줄) 크론은 “매일 9시!”처럼 정확한 타이밍이 중요한 알림에 좋아요! 약 복용 알림, 회의 10분 전 리마인드 같은 것들이요! 어떤 걸 쓰면 좋을까요? 정확한 시간 중요 → Cron 여러 점검을 묶기 → Heartbeat 10. 보안/운영 팁( 진짜 중요해요! ) 10-1) DM을 open 으로 열면 생기는 일 누구나 봇에게 DM을 보낼 수 있어요! 스팸/악성 프롬프트 유입 가능성이 커져요! 도구 실행 권한 까지 열려 있으면 위험합니다! 권장 운영 방식 🙇 가능하면 pairing 또는 allowlist 로 제한하시고 그룹도 allowlist 기반으로 운영하시는 걸 추천드립니다! 10-2) 도구(특히 쉘 실행 )는 단계적으로 여는 게 좋아요 “컴퓨터를 꺼줘요”, “파일을 지워줘요” 같은 요청은 OS 권한과 연결돼요! 처음부터 다 열기보다, 필요할 때마다 승인 / 제한 / 허용목록 같은 안전장치를 붙이는 게 좋아요! 보안 재앙이 될 수 있는 무서운 가재 11. 트러블슈팅(증상별 빠른 해결) 증상 A) 텔레그램이 답을 안 해요 DM이면: dmPolicy 가 pair\",\n  \"truncated\": true,\n  \"content_length\": 7144\n}"}], "structuredContent": {"result": {"ok": true, "url": "https://thenext-ai.tistory.com/3", "final_url": "https://thenext-ai.tistory.com/3", "status_code": 200, "title": "오픈클로 설치 완벽 가이드 (2026-02-12)", "content": "오픈클로 설치 완벽 가이드 (2026-02-12) 미래를 읽다 (2026 AI/코딩/로봇/핀테크) --> 메뉴 미래를 읽다 (2026 AI/코딩/로봇/핀테크) 2026 AI 핫 트렌드 (18) 로컬 LLM & SLLM (2) AI 핫이슈 (8) OpenClaw（moltbot） (4) 오픈클로 설치부터 운용까지 (2) 각종 신기술 가지고 놀기 (4) 홈 태그 방명록 RSS 피드 로그인 로그아웃 글쓰기 관리 미래를 읽다 (2026 AI/코딩/로봇/핀테크) 컨텐츠 검색 블로그 내 검색 태그 AI부업 #수익자동화 #MicroSaaS #API수익화 #AI에이전트 #2026부업트렌드 #개발자부업 #AI저작권 #자동화수익 #테크리포트 OpenClaw #텔레그램봇 #getUpdates #409Conflict #운영이슈 #트러블슈팅 #재시작 #DevOps #보안 #자동화 제미나이3.1 #Gemini3.1 #LLM트렌드 #에이전틱AI #미래를읽다 #구글AI #GPT5 #알파벳주가 #엔비디아 #AI투자전략 LLAMA #LLM #AI #2026AI OLLAMA # 클라우드 자격증 바이브코딩 #VibeCoding #AI개발 #개발트렌드 #로컬LLM #생산성 #프롬프트 #테스트 #보안 #프로토타입 국내주식 #AI주식 #AI투자 #NAVER #SK하이닉스 #SK텔레콤 #테마주 #밸류체인 #데이터센터 #투자유의 AWS OpenClaw #오픈클로 #AI에이전트 #자동화 #텔레그램봇 #브라우저자동화 #DevOps #보안 #트러블슈팅 #생산성 로컬LLM #Ollama #NSFW #AI검열 #개인정보보호 #Llama3 #오픈소스AI #GPU서버 #인공지능트렌드 #GitHubTrending #오픈소스 #개발트렌드 #AI도구 #벡터DB #RAG #자동화 #에이전트 #백테스트 #개발자추천 로컬LLM # 보안 자격증 HBM4 #HBF #하이브리드본딩 #미래를읽다 #한미반도체 #SK하이닉스 #삼성전자 #AI반도체주식 #테크트렌드 #패키징공정 Google Data Analytics 2026트렌드 #IT아이템 #스마트기기 #온디바이스AI #패스키 #보안 #생산성 #회의록 #녹음기 윈도우11 #윈도우10 #유틸리티 #생산성 #PowerToys #Everything #ShareX #7zip #백업 #윈도우세팅 sLLM #LLM #2026AI #AI 기업 힉스필드사용법 #HiggsfieldAI #AI영상제작 #생성형AI비디오 #시네마틱AI #딥페이크주의 #AI보안 #Runway대안 #마케팅자동화 #테크리포트 최근글 GPT-5를 넘어선 구글의 반격? 제미나이 3.1 성능⋯ [Deep Tech] HBM4와 HBF(Hybrid B⋯ AI 부업의 시대, 기술적 해자(Moat)를 만드는 핵⋯ 1분 만에 끝내는 고퀄리티 홍보 영상 제작: 힉스필드(⋯ 댓글 공지사항 아카이브 2026/02 오픈클로 설치 완벽 가이드 (2026-02-12) 2026. 2. 12. 11:34 ㆍ OpenClaw（moltbot）/오픈클로 설치부터 운용까지 OPEN CLAW(OpenClaw) 완전 정복 가이드 OPEN CLAW 설치 따라하기 처음 설치하시는 분들도 따라오실 수 있게, 핵심 개념부터 설정/운영/트러블슈팅까지 차근차근 풀어볼게요 😊 목차 1.

OpenClaw 한 문장 정의 2. 핵심 개념(구성요소) 한 번에 이해하기 3. 전체 동작 흐름(메시지가 오면 무슨 일이 벌어지나요?) 4. 시작 흐름(초보자용 체크리스트) 5. 설정(채널/정책) 기초 6. 텔레그램 연결에서 자주 막히는 포인트 7. 스킬(Skills)과 플러그인(Plugins) 8. 메모리(MEMORY.md)와 장기 기억을 안전하게 쓰는 법 9. 자동화: Heartbeat vs Cron 10. 보안/운영 팁(진짜 중요해요!) 11. 트러블슈팅(증상별 빠른 해결) 12. 바로 써먹는 템플릿 “EXFOLIATE! EXFOLIATE!” — A space lobster, probably (탈피하라 ! 탈피하라 ! - openclaw 공식 문구 ㄷㄷㄷ-) 1. OpenClaw 한 문장 정의 OpenClaw, 한 문장으로 말하면 “내 컴퓨터(또는 서버)에서 돌아가는 개인 AI 비서 허브” 예요! (자세한건 지난글 참고!) 텔레그램/디스코드 같은 메신저 에서 메시지가 오면 OpenClaw가 그걸 받아서 LLM(예: OpenAI 계열 모델 등)로 답을 만들고 다시 메신저로 답장을 보내주는 구조라고 보시면 돼요! 포인트 ✨ 단순히 “말만 하는 챗봇”이 아니라, 파일 작업 , 자동화 , 도구 실행 까지 연결해서 정말 “비서처럼” 확장할 수 있게 만들어져 있어요! 2. 핵심 개념(구성요소) 한 번에 이해하기 Gateway(게이트웨이) OpenClaw의 본체 서비스 예요! 채널에서 메시지를 받고, 모델 호출/툴 실행/응답 전송을 담당해요! 쉽게 말하면 “항상 켜져 있는 허브” 느낌입니다 Agent(에이전트) 말투/규칙/도구 접근/워크스페이스 같은 성격과 역할 이 들어있는 단위예요! 한 게이트웨이에서 여러 에이전트를 두는 것도 가능해요! Workspace(워크스페이스) 에이전트가 읽고/쓰고/작업하는 폴더예요! 메모, 문서, 스크립트, 프로젝트 코드 같은 게 여기 들어갑니다! Channel(채널) Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp 같은 “외부 메신저 연결”이에요! 즉 “어디서 말을 걸 수 있냐”를 정해주는 친구죠! Tools(도구) 파일 읽기/쓰기, 쉘 실행 , 브라우저 자동화 같은 “행동” 기능이에요! 설정으로 허용/차단도 가능해서 안전하게 운영할 수 있어요! Skills(스킬) 특정 작업을 잘 하게 해주는 “레시피/패키지”라고 보시면 돼요! 예: 보안 점검 , 특정 채널 연동 같은 것들요! Memory(메모리) 대화/노트에서 중요한 내용을 저장하고, 나중에 검색해서 꺼내 쓰는 기능이에요! 장기 기억처럼 쓰면 정말 편해지는데, 보안 은 꼭 챙겨야 해요! 잠깐만요! (주의) ⚠️ OpenClaw는 “내 컴퓨터에서 돌아가는 서비스”예요! 설정을 잘못하면 누구나 내 비서에게 DM을 보내게(open) 될 수 있어요! 편의성 도 좋지만, 보안 도 같이 잡아주시는 걸 추천드려요! 3. 전체 동작 흐름(메시지가 오면 무슨 일이 벌어지나요?) 흐름은 대충 이렇게 굴러가요! ① 텔레그램에서 사용자가 메시지를 보냄 ② OpenClaw Gateway가 메시지를 수신 ③ (정책 확인) 이 사람/이 채팅에서 응답해도 되는지 체크 ④ 대화 기록 + 시스템 프롬프트 + 필요한 파일/메모리를 조합해 모델에 요청 ⑤ 필요하면 도구 실행(파일 읽기, 웹 조회, 스크립트 실행 등) ⑥ 모델이 최종 답변 생성 ⑦ 텔레그램으로 답변 전송 초보자 꿀팁 😊 “왜 답을 안 하지?”는 대부분 ③번에서 터집니다! 즉 dmPolicy / groupPolicy / allowlist 같은 접근 제어 설정이 원인인 경우가 정말 많아요! 4. 시작 흐름(초보자용 체크리스트) 환경마다 약간 다르긴 한데요, 처음엔 아래 순서로 가시면 마음이 편해요! 4-1) 목표부터 정해볼게요! 어디서 부를 건가요? (예: 텔레그램 DM / 디스코드 서버) 어디까지 하게 할 건가요? (대화만 / 파일 작업 / 자동화) 항상 켜져 있어야 하나요? (PC 상시 / 서버/VPS) 4-2) 텔레그램을 쓰신다면 @BotFather로 봇 생성 Bot Token 확보 봇이 메시지를 받을 수 있는지 확인(차단/프라이버시 설정) 4-3) “켜져 있어야 한다”는 것만 기억해주세요! OpenClaw는 게이트웨이 가 살아 있어야 답장을 해요! PC를 종료하면 당연히 답을 못 하고요! (만약 다른 머신에서 돌아가고 있으면 그쪽이 답할 수도 있어요!) 5. 설정(채널/정책) 기초 OpenClaw는 보통 설정 파일( openclaw.json )에서 “누가 어디서 말을 걸면 답해줄지”를 정해요! 5-1) 텔레그램 DM 정책(dmPolicy) pairing : 페어링된 사용자만 DM 응답 (안전한 기본값 느낌!) allowlist : 허용목록에 있는 사용자만 응답 open : 누구에게나 응답 (편하지만 위험할 수 있어요!) disabled : DM 응답 꺼짐 보안 얘기 조금만 할게요 🙏 open 은 말 그대로 “아무나” DM을 보내도 반응합니다! 도구 실행(쉘 실행 같은 것) 이 열려 있으면 위험도가 확 올라가요! 가능하면 pairing 또는 allowlist 로 시작하시는 걸 추천드려요! 5-2) 그룹 정책(groupPolicy) allowlist : 허용된 그룹에서만 반응 open : 모든 그룹에서 반응 (역시 조심!) disabled : 그룹 응답 꺼짐 5-3) “답변이 안 온다”의 대부분은 정책 문제예요! 봇이 살아 있는데도 무응답이면, 모델 문제가 아니라 “정책상 무응답이 정상”인 경우가 진짜 많습니다 😅 6. 텔레그램 연결에서 자주 막히는 포인트 6-1) 텔레그램에서 ‘대답 안 함’ 체크리스트 게이트웨이가 실행 중인가요? (서비스/프로세스) 봇 토큰이 맞나요? DM 정책이 pairing 인데 페어링을 안 한 건 아닌가요? 그룹이라면 groupPolicy가 allowlist 인데 그룹을 허용하지 않은 건 아닌가요? 봇이 해당 그룹에서 메시지를 받을 수 있는 상태인가요? 추천 운영 방식 👍 처음엔 “DM만” 연결하고, pairing/allowlist 로 제한해서 안정화한 뒤에 그룹이나 고급 도구를 여는 게 제일 안전하고 편해요! 7. 스킬(Skills)과 플러그인(Plugins) 7-1) 스킬(Skills)이 뭐예요? 스킬은 특정 작업을 “잘 하게” 만드는 레시피 묶음이에요! 보안 점검 , 채널 연동 같은 복잡한 작업을 순서대로 수행하도록 도와줍니다! 7-2) 플러그인(Plugins)은요? 텔레그램/디스코드 같은 채널 연결, 인증, 메모리 엔진 확장처럼 기능을 모듈로 추가하는 방식이에요! 정리해드릴게요! 플러그인 = 기능을 추가/확장하는 부품 느낌 스킬 = 그 기능을 이용해서 일을 “잘 되게” 만드는 사용법/레시피 느낌 8. 메모리(MEMORY.md)와 장기 기억을 안전하게 쓰는 법 오래 쓰다 보면 “취향/프로젝트 맥락/자주 하는 작업”을 기억해두면 엄청 편해요! 보통은 이런 식으로 정리합니다!

DM 정책이 pairing 인데 페어링을 안 한 건 아닌가요? 그룹이라면 groupPolicy가 allowlist 인데 그룹을 허용하지 않은 건 아닌가요? 봇이 해당 그룹에서 메시지를 받을 수 있는 상태인가요? 추천 운영 방식 👍 처음엔 “DM만” 연결하고, pairing/allowlist 로 제한해서 안정화한 뒤에 그룹이나 고급 도구를 여는 게 제일 안전하고 편해요! 7. 스킬(Skills)과 플러그인(Plugins) 7-1) 스킬(Skills)이 뭐예요? 스킬은 특정 작업을 “잘 하게” 만드는 레시피 묶음이에요! 보안 점검 , 채널 연동 같은 복잡한 작업을 순서대로 수행하도록 도와줍니다! 7-2) 플러그인(Plugins)은요? 텔레그램/디스코드 같은 채널 연결, 인증, 메모리 엔진 확장처럼 기능을 모듈로 추가하는 방식이에요! 정리해드릴게요! 플러그인 = 기능을 추가/확장하는 부품 느낌 스킬 = 그 기능을 이용해서 일을 “잘 되게” 만드는 사용법/레시피 느낌 8. 메모리(MEMORY.md)와 장기 기억을 안전하게 쓰는 법 오래 쓰다 보면 “취향/프로젝트 맥락/자주 하는 작업”을 기억해두면 엄청 편해요! 보통은 이런 식으로 정리합니다!

Credit: ozalpvahid / Shutterstock 엔도어랩스(Endor Labs) 연구팀이 ‘AI 에이전트를 위한 소셜 미디어’로 알려진 오픈소스 AI 에이전트 프레임워크 오픈클로(OpenClaw)에서 중·고위험 취약점 6건을 발견했다. 취약점은 엔도어랩스가 AI 기반 정적 애플리케이션 보안 테스트(SAST) 엔진으로 플랫폼을 분석하는 과정에서 확인됐다. 해당 엔진은 에이전틱 AI 소프트웨어 내부에서 데이터가 실제로 어떻게 이동하는지 추적하도록 설계됐다. 이번에 확인된 취약점은 서버사이드 요청 위조(SSRF), 웹훅 인증 누락, 인증 우회, 경로 조작(Path Traversal) 등 여러 웹 보안 범주에 걸쳐 있다.

Credit: ozalpvahid / Shutterstock 엔도어랩스(Endor Labs) 연구팀이 ‘AI 에이전트를 위한 소셜 미디어’로 알려진 오픈소스 AI 에이전트 프레임워크 오픈클로(OpenClaw)에서 중·고위험 취약점 6건을 발견했다. 취약점은 엔도어랩스가 AI 기반 정적 애플리케이션 보안 테스트(SAST) 엔진으로 플랫폼을 분석하는 과정에서 확인됐다. 해당 엔진은 에이전틱 AI 소프트웨어 내부에서 데이터가 실제로 어떻게 이동하는지 추적하도록 설계됐다. 이번에 확인된 취약점은 서버사이드 요청 위조(SSRF), 웹훅 인증 누락, 인증 우회, 경로 조작(Path Traversal) 등 여러 웹 보안 범주에 걸쳐 있다. LLM과 도구 실행, 외부 연동을 결합한 복합적인 에이전트형 시스템 전반에 영향을 미친다. 연구팀은 각 취약점에 대해 실제 동작하는 개념증명(PoC) 익스플로잇도 공개해 현실 환경에서 악용 가능성을 입증했다. 오픈클로 측은 해당 문제에 대한 패치와 보안 권고문을 발표했다.

(CVE-2026-25253) 2026년 02월 21일 작성자: Moonit 복사됨! 오픈클로(OpenClaw) AI 에이전트에서 링크 하나만 클릭해도 시스템이 장악되는 원격 코드 실행 취약점이 발견됐습니다. CVE-2026-25253 보안 이슈와 클로허브 공급망 공격까지, 지금 당장 확인해야 할 내용을 정리했습니다. 한눈에 보는 블로그 정리 CVE-2026-25253은 CVSS 8.8 고위험 취약점으로, 악성 링크 클릭 한 번으로 시스템 전체가 장악될 수 있습니다. 로컬 환경에서도 예외 없이 공격이 가능하며, 방화벽조차 우회합니다. 클로허브 마켓플레이스에서는 1,184개의 악성 스킬이 추가로 발견돼 이중 위협이 현실화됐습니다. 네이버, 카카오, 당근 등 국내 주요 IT 기업들이 사내 사용을 전면 차단했습니다. 2026.1.29 버전 이상으로 즉시 업데이트하고 토큰과 API 키를 전면 재발급해야 합니다. 목차 Toggle AI 비서가 해커의 문을 열어줬다 취약점 작동 방식, 생각보다 단순해서 더 무섭습니다 클로허브 마켓플레이스, 또 다른 위협의 진원지 국내 대형 IT 기업들은 이미 차단했습니다 관련 뉴스 지금 당장 해야 할 조치 체크리스트 AI 에이전트 시대, 보안 설계 방식이 바뀌어야 합니다 마치며 함께 보면 좋은 글 AI 비서가 해커의 문을 열어줬다 오픈클로는 슬랙, 텔레그램, iMessage 같은 메신저는 물론이고 로컬 파일 시스템까지 직접 제어하는 자율형 AI 에이전트입니다. 전 세계 13만 5천 개 이상의 인스턴스가 실제 업무에 활용되고 있을 만큼 개발자들 사이에서 인기가 높습니다. 그런데 바로 그 넓은 권한이 이번 사태의 핵심 문제였습니다. 보안 연구팀 depthfirst 가 코드를 감사하던 중 취약점을 발견했습니다. 편의성을 위해 설계된 자동 연결 기능이 어느 순간 공격자의 뒷문이 되어 있었던 것입니다. Cisco Talos는 오픈클로를 두고 생산성 측면에서는 획기적이지만 보안 측면에서는 심각한 도전이라고 평가했습니다. 취약점 작동 방식, 생각보다 단순해서 더 무섭습니다 이번 취약점의 핵심은 오픈클로 컨트롤 UI가 URL에 포함된 gatewayUrl 파라미터를 아무런 검증 없이 신뢰한다는 점입니다. 공격자가 만든 링크를 사용자가 클릭하는 순간, 오픈클로는 스스로 공격자 서버로 인증 토큰을 전송합니다. 공격 단계 발생 상황 결과 1단계 악성 링크 클릭 또는 페이지 방문 인증 토큰 공격자 서버로 유출 2단계 크로스사이트 웹소켓 하이재킹(CSWSH) 로컬 방화벽 우회, localhost 직접 접근 3단계 샌드박스 비활성화, 안전장치 해제 API 명령으로 보안 설정 제거 4단계 임의 명령 실행 시스템 전체 장악 완료 더 충격적인 건 로컬 환경도 안전하지 않다 는 사실입니다. 일반적으로 인터넷에서 localhost는 접근이 불가능하지만, 브라우저는 HTTP와 달리 웹소켓 연결에는 동일 출처 정책(SOP)을 적용하지 않습니다. 오픈클로의 웹소켓 서버가 오리진 헤더 검증을 하지 않아, 사용자의 브라우저 자체가 공격의 경유지가 됩니다. 클로허브 마켓플레이스, 또 다른 위협의 진원지 CVE-2026-25253 하나만으로도 충분히 심각한데, 더 큰 문제가 따로 있었습니다. 기능 확장을 위한 스킬 마켓플레이스 클로허브(ClawHub)에서 대규모 공급망 공격이 동시에 진행되고 있었습니다. 조사 기관 감사 규모 악성 스킬 수 Koi Security 2,857개 341개 (ClawHavoc 캠페인) 보안 연구팀 전체 1,184개 (12개 계정 업로드) Snyk 3,984개 283개 (7.1%) 인증정보 노출 Bitdefender 전체 약 900개 (전체 20%) 악성 행위 클로허브는 일주일만 지난 깃허브 계정이면 누구나 스킬을 등록할 수 있었습니다. 공격자 한 명이 무려 677개의 악성 패키지를 혼자 올렸습니다. 1위 스킬조차 9개의 보안 취약점을 숨기고 있었고, 수천 번 다운로드됐습니다. 악성코드는 SSH 키, 브라우저 비밀번호, 암호화폐 지갑 정보를 조용히 빼갔습니다. 국내 대형 IT 기업들은 이미 차단했습니다 국내 보안 업계도 신속하게 반응했습니다. 안랩 ASEC는 이번 취약점이 AI 에이전트의 광범위한 권한을 노린 고도화된 공격이라며 특별 경고를 발령했습니다. KISA 역시 긴급 보안 권고를 통해 즉시 업데이트를 촉구했습니다. 실제 대응도 빠르게 이뤄졌습니다. 연합뉴스 보도에 따르면 네이버, 카카오, 당근 등 국내 주요 IT 기업들이 2월 초 사내망과 업무용 기기에서 오픈클로 사용을 전면 차단했습니다. AI 비서 도구 하나가 내부망 전체를 위험에 빠뜨릴 수 있다는 인식이 기업 보안 담당자들 사이에서 빠르게 확산된 결과입니다. 관련 뉴스 네이버·카카오·당근 등 ‘오픈클로’ 사내 사용 제한 지금 당장 해야 할 조치 체크리스트 오픈클로는 1월 30일 패치 버전을 배포했습니다. 하지만 업데이트 하나로 모든 게 해결되지는 않습니다. 노출 인스턴스 비율이 약 35%에 달한다는 분석도 있어, 이미 탈취됐을 가능성을 전제하고 움직이는 것이 안전합니다. 조치 항목 우선순위 대상 2026.1.29 버전 이상 업데이트 긴급 전체 사용자 게이트웨이 인증 토큰 재발급 긴급 전체 사용자 연결된 서비스 API 키 전면 교체 높음 기업 환경 필수 클로허브 설치 스킬 전수 검토 높음 스킬 사용자 웹소켓 트래픽 이상 로그 점검 권고 기업 보안팀 SSH 키 및 암호화폐 지갑 재확인 권고 개발자, 크립토 사용자 AI 에이전트 시대, 보안 설계 방식이 바뀌어야 합니다 보안 전문가 Simon Willison이 제시한 치명적 삼위일체 라는 개념이 주목받고 있습니다. 개인 데이터 접근 권한, 신뢰할 수 없는 외부 콘텐츠 노출, 외부 통신 기능, 이 세 가지가 동시에 충족되는 순간 AI 에이전트는 정보 유출의 완벽한 통로가 된다는 것입니다. 오픈클로는 세 조건 모두에 해당합니다. AI 에이전트가 수십 개 서비스에 연결되는 환경이 일상이 된 지금, 비인간 신원(NHI) 관리라는 새로운 보안 개념이 기업의 핵심 과제로 떠올랐습니다. 편의성이 높아진 만큼 한 번의 침투가 만드는 피해의 범위도 기하급수적으로 커졌기 때문입니다. 이번 사태가 단순한 취약점 패치로 끝날 문제가 아닌 이유가 바로 여기에 있습니다. 마치며 오픈클로 CVE-2026-25253은 AI 에이전트에 넓은 권한을 부여할수록 보안 위험도 함께 커진다는 사실을 정면으로 보여줬습니다. 지금 사용 중이라면 즉시 업데이트와 토큰 재발급부터 시작하세요. 함께 보면 좋은 글 지브리 ai 이미지를 영상으로 만드는 2가지 방법 AI로 웹툰 그리기 | 나만의 스토리를 4컷으로? 사이버 보안 강화로 주목받는 디도스 관련주 Top3 스마트폰 광고 제거하는 가장 확실한 프라이빗 DNS 설정법 구형 노트북 우분투 설치법, 오픈클로 실행을 위한 첫걸음 댓글 남기기 응답 취소 댓글 이름 다음 번 댓글 작성을 위해 이 브라우저에 이름, 이메일, 그리고 웹사이트를 저장합니다. 상호 : 도리하우스 주소지 : 대구 남구, E-mail : kwojiro486@gmail.com 저작권자 © 도리하우스 © 2026 Moonit • 제작됨 GeneratePress 트렌드 리뷰 모바일 모바일 앱 운영체제 소프트웨어 하드웨어 정보 웹 게임 정보보안 AI 공부 Close 목차 × AI 비서가 해커의 문을 열어줬다 취약점 작동 방식, 생각보다 단순해서 더 무섭습니다 클로허브 마켓플레이스, 또 다른 위협의 진원지 국내 대형 IT 기업들은 이미 차단했습니다 관련 뉴스 지금 당장 해야 할 조치 체크리스트 AI 에이전트 시대, 보안 설계 방식이 바뀌어야 합니다 마치며 함께 보면 좋은 글 → 목차 검색:\",\n  \"truncated\": false,\n  \"content_length\": 3861\n}"}], "structuredContent": {"result": {"ok": true, "url": "https://moonit.kr/openclaw-cve-2026-25253-security-vulnerability/", "final_url": "https://moonit.kr/openclaw-cve-2026-25253-security-vulnerability/", "status_code": 200, "title": "오픈클로 우려했던 보안 문제 현실로?

CVE-2026-25253 보안 이슈와 클로허브 공급망 공격까지, 지금 당장 확인해야 할 내용을 정리했습니다. 한눈에 보는 블로그 정리 CVE-2026-25253은 CVSS 8.8 고위험 취약점으로, 악성 링크 클릭 한 번으로 시스템 전체가 장악될 수 있습니다. 로컬 환경에서도 예외 없이 공격이 가능하며, 방화벽조차 우회합니다. 클로허브 마켓플레이스에서는 1,184개의 악성 스킬이 추가로 발견돼 이중 위협이 현실화됐습니다. 네이버, 카카오, 당근 등 국내 주요 IT 기업들이 사내 사용을 전면 차단했습니다. 2026.1.29 버전 이상으로 즉시 업데이트하고 토큰과 API 키를 전면 재발급해야 합니다. 목차 Toggle AI 비서가 해커의 문을 열어줬다 취약점 작동 방식, 생각보다 단순해서 더 무섭습니다 클로허브 마켓플레이스, 또 다른 위협의 진원지 국내 대형 IT 기업들은 이미 차단했습니다 관련 뉴스 지금 당장 해야 할 조치 체크리스트 AI 에이전트 시대, 보안 설계 방식이 바뀌어야 합니다 마치며 함께 보면 좋은 글 AI 비서가 해커의 문을 열어줬다 오픈클로는 슬랙, 텔레그램, iMessage 같은 메신저는 물론이고 로컬 파일 시스템까지 직접 제어하는 자율형 AI 에이전트입니다. 전 세계 13만 5천 개 이상의 인스턴스가 실제 업무에 활용되고 있을 만큼 개발자들 사이에서 인기가 높습니다. 그런데 바로 그 넓은 권한이 이번 사태의 핵심 문제였습니다. 보안 연구팀 depthfirst 가 코드를 감사하던 중 취약점을 발견했습니다. 편의성을 위해 설계된 자동 연결 기능이 어느 순간 공격자의 뒷문이 되어 있었던 것입니다. Cisco Talos는 오픈클로를 두고 생산성 측면에서는 획기적이지만 보안 측면에서는 심각한 도전이라고 평가했습니다. 취약점 작동 방식, 생각보다 단순해서 더 무섭습니다 이번 취약점의 핵심은 오픈클로 컨트롤 UI가 URL에 포함된 gatewayUrl 파라미터를 아무런 검증 없이 신뢰한다는 점입니다. 공격자가 만든 링크를 사용자가 클릭하는 순간, 오픈클로는 스스로 공격자 서버로 인증 토큰을 전송합니다. 공격 단계 발생 상황 결과 1단계 악성 링크 클릭 또는 페이지 방문 인증 토큰 공격자 서버로 유출 2단계 크로스사이트 웹소켓 하이재킹(CSWSH) 로컬 방화벽 우회, localhost 직접 접근 3단계 샌드박스 비활성화, 안전장치 해제 API 명령으로 보안 설정 제거 4단계 임의 명령 실행 시스템 전체 장악 완료 더 충격적인 건 로컬 환경도 안전하지 않다 는 사실입니다. 일반적으로 인터넷에서 localhost는 접근이 불가능하지만, 브라우저는 HTTP와 달리 웹소켓 연결에는 동일 출처 정책(SOP)을 적용하지 않습니다. 오픈클로의 웹소켓 서버가 오리진 헤더 검증을 하지 않아, 사용자의 브라우저 자체가 공격의 경유지가 됩니다. 클로허브 마켓플레이스, 또 다른 위협의 진원지 CVE-2026-25253 하나만으로도 충분히 심각한데, 더 큰 문제가 따로 있었습니다. 기능 확장을 위한 스킬 마켓플레이스 클로허브(ClawHub)에서 대규모 공급망 공격이 동시에 진행되고 있었습니다. 조사 기관 감사 규모 악성 스킬 수 Koi Security 2,857개 341개 (ClawHavoc 캠페인) 보안 연구팀 전체 1,184개 (12개 계정 업로드) Snyk 3,984개 283개 (7.1%) 인증정보 노출 Bitdefender 전체 약 900개 (전체 20%) 악성 행위 클로허브는 일주일만 지난 깃허브 계정이면 누구나 스킬을 등록할 수 있었습니다. 공격자 한 명이 무려 677개의 악성 패키지를 혼자 올렸습니다. 1위 스킬조차 9개의 보안 취약점을 숨기고 있었고, 수천 번 다운로드됐습니다. 악성코드는 SSH 키, 브라우저 비밀번호, 암호화폐 지갑 정보를 조용히 빼갔습니다. 국내 대형 IT 기업들은 이미 차단했습니다 국내 보안 업계도 신속하게 반응했습니다. 안랩 ASEC는 이번 취약점이 AI 에이전트의 광범위한 권한을 노린 고도화된 공격이라며 특별 경고를 발령했습니다. KISA 역시 긴급 보안 권고를 통해 즉시 업데이트를 촉구했습니다. 실제 대응도 빠르게 이뤄졌습니다. 연합뉴스 보도에 따르면 네이버, 카카오, 당근 등 국내 주요 IT 기업들이 2월 초 사내망과 업무용 기기에서 오픈클로 사용을 전면 차단했습니다. AI 비서 도구 하나가 내부망 전체를 위험에 빠뜨릴 수 있다는 인식이 기업 보안 담당자들 사이에서 빠르게 확산된 결과입니다. 관련 뉴스 네이버·카카오·당근 등 ‘오픈클로’ 사내 사용 제한 지금 당장 해야 할 조치 체크리스트 오픈클로는 1월 30일 패치 버전을 배포했습니다. 하지만 업데이트 하나로 모든 게 해결되지는 않습니다. 노출 인스턴스 비율이 약 35%에 달한다는 분석도 있어, 이미 탈취됐을 가능성을 전제하고 움직이는 것이 안전합니다. 조치 항목 우선순위 대상 2026.1.29 버전 이상 업데이트 긴급 전체 사용자 게이트웨이 인증 토큰 재발급 긴급 전체 사용자 연결된 서비스 API 키 전면 교체 높음 기업 환경 필수 클로허브 설치 스킬 전수 검토 높음 스킬 사용자 웹소켓 트래픽 이상 로그 점검 권고 기업 보안팀 SSH 키 및 암호화폐 지갑 재확인 권고 개발자, 크립토 사용자 AI 에이전트 시대, 보안 설계 방식이 바뀌어야 합니다 보안 전문가 Simon Willison이 제시한 치명적 삼위일체 라는 개념이 주목받고 있습니다. 개인 데이터 접근 권한, 신뢰할 수 없는 외부 콘텐츠 노출, 외부 통신 기능, 이 세 가지가 동시에 충족되는 순간 AI 에이전트는 정보 유출의 완벽한 통로가 된다는 것입니다. 오픈클로는 세 조건 모두에 해당합니다. AI 에이전트가 수십 개 서비스에 연결되는 환경이 일상이 된 지금, 비인간 신원(NHI) 관리라는 새로운 보안 개념이 기업의 핵심 과제로 떠올랐습니다. 편의성이 높아진 만큼 한 번의 침투가 만드는 피해의 범위도 기하급수적으로 커졌기 때문입니다. 이번 사태가 단순한 취약점 패치로 끝날 문제가 아닌 이유가 바로 여기에 있습니다. 마치며 오픈클로 CVE-2026-25253은 AI 에이전트에 넓은 권한을 부여할수록 보안 위험도 함께 커진다는 사실을 정면으로 보여줬습니다. 지금 사용 중이라면 즉시 업데이트와 토큰 재발급부터 시작하세요. 함께 보면 좋은 글 지브리 ai 이미지를 영상으로 만드는 2가지 방법 AI로 웹툰 그리기 | 나만의 스토리를 4컷으로? 사이버 보안 강화로 주목받는 디도스 관련주 Top3 스마트폰 광고 제거하는 가장 확실한 프라이빗 DNS 설정법 구형 노트북 우분투 설치법, 오픈클로 실행을 위한 첫걸음 댓글 남기기 응답 취소 댓글 이름 다음 번 댓글 작성을 위해 이 브라우저에 이름, 이메일, 그리고 웹사이트를 저장합니다. 상호 : 도리하우스 주소지 : 대구 남구, E-mail : kwojiro486@gmail.com 저작권자 © 도리하우스 © 2026 Moonit • 제작됨 GeneratePress 트렌드 리뷰 모바일 모바일 앱 운영체제 소프트웨어 하드웨어 정보 웹 게임 정보보안 AI 공부 Close 목차 × AI 비서가 해커의 문을 열어줬다 취약점 작동 방식, 생각보다 단순해서 더 무섭습니다 클로허브 마켓플레이스, 또 다른 위협의 진원지 국내 대형 IT 기업들은 이미 차단했습니다 관련 뉴스 지금 당장 해야 할 조치 체크리스트 AI 에이전트 시대, 보안 설계 방식이 바뀌어야 합니다 마치며 함께 보면 좋은 글 → 목차 검색:", "truncated": false, "content_length": 3861}}, "isError": false}}, "session_seq": 345}

AI 에이전트 특성상 이메일이나 캘린더, 파일 시스템 등에 광범위한 접근 권한을 가지고 있어, 한 번의 침투로도 심각한 데이터 유출 사고로 이어질 수 있기 때문이다. 최근 북한 배후 해킹 조직들이 국내 소프트웨어의 제로데이 취약점을 공격에 적극 활용하고 있는 만큼, 비서 도구로 활용되는 오픈클로 사용자들은 각별한 주의가 필요하다. 지난 연휴 사이 국내 주요 IT 기업들도 사내망과 업무용 기기에서 오픈클로 사용을 제한했다. 즉각 업데이트와 토큰 재발급 필수 오픈클로는 1월말 이번 취약점에 대해 패치를 배포했다. 사용자는 현재 버전을 확인해 2026.1.29 버전 이상으로 즉시 업데이트해야 한다. 패치 적용만으로 안심하긴 이르다. 노출 가능성이 있는 토큰과 API키가 깃허브나 슬랙 등 개발·협업 도구에 남아 있을 수 있어 이를 찾아내 폐기해야 한다. 특히 사내에서 오픈클로를 활용했던 기업이라면 이 에이전트가 연결된 모든 서비스의 크리덴셜을 점검하는 것을 권장한다 보안 업계 관계자는 “최근 에이전틱 AI 활용이 늘어나면서 관련 문제점도 늘어나는 추세”라며 “활용도가 높아진 만큼, AI에 더 큰 권한을 부여할 경우 취약점에 대한 RCE 취약점 악용 공격이 가능해지는 만큼 심각한 보안사고로 이어질 수 있다”고 말했다. 이어 “하나의 에이전트가 수십 개 서비스에 연결되는 환경이 일상화되고 있는데, 편의성이 높아진 만큼 크리덴셜이 유출되면 피해 범위도 커지기 때문에 비인간 신원(NHI: Non-Human Identity)에 대한 보안 관리가 기업 보안의 새로운 과제로 떠오르고 있다”고 말했다. 오픈클로는 최근 공개적으로 보안 자문 풀을 운영하면서 보안성 강화를 진행하고 있으며, 오픈AI와 협업을 시작했다.

AI 에이전트 특성상 이메일이나 캘린더, 파일 시스템 등에 광범위한 접근 권한을 가지고 있어, 한 번의 침투로도 심각한 데이터 유출 사고로 이어질 수 있기 때문이다. 최근 북한 배후 해킹 조직들이 국내 소프트웨어의 제로데이 취약점을 공격에 적극 활용하고 있는 만큼, 비서 도구로 활용되는 오픈클로 사용자들은 각별한 주의가 필요하다. 지난 연휴 사이 국내 주요 IT 기업들도 사내망과 업무용 기기에서 오픈클로 사용을 제한했다. 즉각 업데이트와 토큰 재발급 필수 오픈클로는 1월말 이번 취약점에 대해 패치를 배포했다. 사용자는 현재 버전을 확인해 2026.1.29 버전 이상으로 즉시 업데이트해야 한다. 패치 적용만으로 안심하긴 이르다. 노출 가능성이 있는 토큰과 API키가 깃허브나 슬랙 등 개발·협업 도구에 남아 있을 수 있어 이를 찾아내 폐기해야 한다. 특히 사내에서 오픈클로를 활용했던 기업이라면 이 에이전트가 연결된 모든 서비스의 크리덴셜을 점검하는 것을 권장한다 보안 업계 관계자는 “최근 에이전틱 AI 활용이 늘어나면서 관련 문제점도 늘어나는 추세”라며 “활용도가 높아진 만큼, AI에 더 큰 권한을 부여할 경우 취약점에 대한 RCE 취약점 악용 공격이 가능해지는 만큼 심각한 보안사고로 이어질 수 있다”고 말했다. 이어 “하나의 에이전트가 수십 개 서비스에 연결되는 환경이 일상화되고 있는데, 편의성이 높아진 만큼 크리덴셜이 유출되면 피해 범위도 커지기 때문에 비인간 신원(NHI: Non-Human Identity)에 대한 보안 관리가 기업 보안의 새로운 과제로 떠오르고 있다”고 말했다. 오픈클로는 최근 공개적으로 보안 자문 풀을 운영하면서 보안성 강화를 진행하고 있으며, 오픈AI와 협업을 시작했다.

A. 전면 중단보다는 권한 설정을 검토해야 합니다. 특히 금융, 이메일, 클라우드 저장소에 대한 접근 권한 중 불필요한 항목은 즉시 취소하는 것을 권장합니다. Q. 프롬프트 주입 공격을 방어할 수 있는 기술적 장치가 있나요? A. 현재 완전한 방어 기술은 없습니다. 다만 오픈클로 업데이트를 통해 명령어 필터링 기능이 강화되고 있으므로 최신 버전 유지가 중요합니다. 본 포스팅은 2026년 2월 13일 기준의 기술 뉴스를 바탕으로 작성되었으며, 개인의 상황에 따라 보안 위험도는 다를 수 있습니다. 상세한 보안 설정은 서비스 제공사의 가이드라인을 반드시 참조하시기 바랍니다. 오픈클로-보안 위험 및 대응 방안 ※ 본 글은 일반 정보 제공용이며 전문적 조언이 아닙니다. 사용 결과에 대한 책임은 독자에게 있으며, 오류·누락 가능성이 있습니다. ※ 본 콘텐츠는 AI가 초안을 작성하고, 인간이 검수·편집했으며 일반 정보 제공용이며 전문적 조언이 아닙니다. 사용 결과에 대한 책임은 독자에게 있으며, 오류·누락 가능성이 있습니다. 반응형 공유하기 게시글 관리 Life Style Rich-풍요로운 삶의 방식 ' AI와 모빌리티 > AI ' 카테고리의 다른 글 AI, 이젠 몸으로 움직인다! 2026년 '피지컬 AI' 트렌드 완벽 해부 (2) 2026.02.23 AI 전력난의 파격적 해법, 우주항공청 '우주 데이터센터' 연구 전격 착수 (5) 2026.02.21 인류의 난제, AI가 풀었다! 구글 딥마인드 알레테이아의 놀라운 수학 능력 (3) 2026.02.08 CES 2026 핵심 요약: 피지컬 AI와 휴머노이드 로봇이 그리는 미래 (2) 2026.02.01 사법 리스크 털어낸 카카오모빌리티, 피지컬 AI로 반전 노린다!

A. 전면 중단보다는 권한 설정을 검토해야 합니다. 특히 금융, 이메일, 클라우드 저장소에 대한 접근 권한 중 불필요한 항목은 즉시 취소하는 것을 권장합니다. Q. 프롬프트 주입 공격을 방어할 수 있는 기술적 장치가 있나요? A. 현재 완전한 방어 기술은 없습니다. 다만 오픈클로 업데이트를 통해 명령어 필터링 기능이 강화되고 있으므로 최신 버전 유지가 중요합니다. 본 포스팅은 2026년 2월 13일 기준의 기술 뉴스를 바탕으로 작성되었으며, 개인의 상황에 따라 보안 위험도는 다를 수 있습니다. 상세한 보안 설정은 서비스 제공사의 가이드라인을 반드시 참조하시기 바랍니다. 오픈클로-보안 위험 및 대응 방안 ※ 본 글은 일반 정보 제공용이며 전문적 조언이 아닙니다. 사용 결과에 대한 책임은 독자에게 있으며, 오류·누락 가능성이 있습니다. ※ 본 콘텐츠는 AI가 초안을 작성하고, 인간이 검수·편집했으며 일반 정보 제공용이며 전문적 조언이 아닙니다. 사용 결과에 대한 책임은 독자에게 있으며, 오류·누락 가능성이 있습니다. 반응형 공유하기 게시글 관리 Life Style Rich-풍요로운 삶의 방식 ' AI와 모빌리티 > AI ' 카테고리의 다른 글 AI, 이젠 몸으로 움직인다! 2026년 '피지컬 AI' 트렌드 완벽 해부 (2) 2026.02.23 AI 전력난의 파격적 해법, 우주항공청 '우주 데이터센터' 연구 전격 착수 (5) 2026.02.21 인류의 난제, AI가 풀었다! 구글 딥마인드 알레테이아의 놀라운 수학 능력 (3) 2026.02.08 CES 2026 핵심 요약: 피지컬 AI와 휴머노이드 로봇이 그리는 미래 (2) 2026.02.01 사법 리스크 털어낸 카카오모빌리티, 피지컬 AI로 반전 노린다!

AI 에이전트 특성상 이메일이나 캘린더, 파일 시스템 등에 광범위한 접근 권한을 가지고 있어, 한 번의 침투로도 심각한 데이터 유출 사고로 이어질 수 있기 때문이다. 최근 북한 배후 해킹 조직들이 국내 소프트웨어의 제로데이 취약점을 공격에 적극 활용하고 있는 만큼, 비서 도구로 활용되는 오픈클로 사용자들은 각별한 주의가 필요하다. 지난 연휴 사이 국내 주요 IT 기업들도 사내망과 업무용 기기에서 오픈클로 사용을 제한했다. 즉각 업데이트와 토큰 재발급 필수 오픈클로는 1월말 이번 취약점에 대해 패치를 배포했다. 사용자는 현재 버전을 확인해 2026.1.29 버전 이상으로 즉시 업데이트해야 한다. 패치 적용만으로 안심하긴 이르다. 노출 가능성이 있는 토큰과 API키가 깃허브나 슬랙 등 개발·협업 도구에 남아 있을 수 있어 이를 찾아내 폐기해야 한다. 특히 사내에서 오픈클로를 활용했던 기업이라면 이 에이전트가 연결된 모든 서비스의 크리덴셜을 점검하는 것을 권장한다 보안 업계 관계자는 “최근 에이전틱 AI 활용이 늘어나면서 관련 문제점도 늘어나는 추세”라며 “활용도가 높아진 만큼, AI에 더 큰 권한을 부여할 경우 취약점에 대한 RCE 취약점 악용 공격이 가능해지는 만큼 심각한 보안사고로 이어질 수 있다”고 말했다. 이어 “하나의 에이전트가 수십 개 서비스에 연결되는 환경이 일상화되고 있는데, 편의성이 높아진 만큼 크리덴셜이 유출되면 피해 범위도 커지기 때문에 비인간 신원(NHI: Non-Human Identity)에 대한 보안 관리가 기업 보안의 새로운 과제로 떠오르고 있다”고 말했다. 오픈클로는 최근 공개적으로 보안 자문 풀을 운영하면서 보안성 강화를 진행하고 있으며, 오픈AI와 협업을 시작했다.

AI 에이전트 특성상 이메일이나 캘린더, 파일 시스템 등에 광범위한 접근 권한을 가지고 있어, 한 번의 침투로도 심각한 데이터 유출 사고로 이어질 수 있기 때문이다. 최근 북한 배후 해킹 조직들이 국내 소프트웨어의 제로데이 취약점을 공격에 적극 활용하고 있는 만큼, 비서 도구로 활용되는 오픈클로 사용자들은 각별한 주의가 필요하다. 지난 연휴 사이 국내 주요 IT 기업들도 사내망과 업무용 기기에서 오픈클로 사용을 제한했다. 즉각 업데이트와 토큰 재발급 필수 오픈클로는 1월말 이번 취약점에 대해 패치를 배포했다. 사용자는 현재 버전을 확인해 2026.1.29 버전 이상으로 즉시 업데이트해야 한다. 패치 적용만으로 안심하긴 이르다. 노출 가능성이 있는 토큰과 API키가 깃허브나 슬랙 등 개발·협업 도구에 남아 있을 수 있어 이를 찾아내 폐기해야 한다. 특히 사내에서 오픈클로를 활용했던 기업이라면 이 에이전트가 연결된 모든 서비스의 크리덴셜을 점검하는 것을 권장한다 보안 업계 관계자는 “최근 에이전틱 AI 활용이 늘어나면서 관련 문제점도 늘어나는 추세”라며 “활용도가 높아진 만큼, AI에 더 큰 권한을 부여할 경우 취약점에 대한 RCE 취약점 악용 공격이 가능해지는 만큼 심각한 보안사고로 이어질 수 있다”고 말했다. 이어 “하나의 에이전트가 수십 개 서비스에 연결되는 환경이 일상화되고 있는데, 편의성이 높아진 만큼 크리덴셜이 유출되면 피해 범위도 커지기 때문에 비인간 신원(NHI: Non-Human Identity)에 대한 보안 관리가 기업 보안의 새로운 과제로 떠오르고 있다”고 말했다. 오픈클로는 최근 공개적으로 보안 자문 풀을 운영하면서 보안성 강화를 진행하고 있으며, 오픈AI와 협업을 시작했다.

AI 에이전트 특성상 이메일이나 캘린더, 파일 시스템 등에 광범위한 접근 권한을 가지고 있어, 한 번의 침투로도 심각한 데이터 유출 사고로 이어질 수 있기 때문이다. 최근 북한 배후 해킹 조직들이 국내 소프트웨어의 제로데이 취약점을 공격에 적극 활용하고 있는 만큼, 비서 도구로 활용되는 오픈클로 사용자들은 각별한 주의가 필요하다. 지난 연휴 사이 국내 주요 IT 기업들도 사내망과 업무용 기기에서 오픈클로 사용을 제한했다. 즉각 업데이트와 토큰 재발급 필수 오픈클로는 1월말 이번 취약점에 대해 패치를 배포했다. 사용자는 현재 버전을 확인해 2026.1.29 버전 이상으로 즉시 업데이트해야 한다. 패치 적용만으로 안심하긴 이르다. 노출 가능성이 있는 토큰과 API키가 깃허브나 슬랙 등 개발·협업 도구에 남아 있을 수 있어 이를 찾아내 폐기해야 한다. 특히 사내에서 오픈클로를 활용했던 기업이라면 이 에이전트가 연결된 모든 서비스의 크리덴셜을 점검하는 것을 권장한다 보안 업계 관계자는 “최근 에이전틱 AI 활용이 늘어나면서 관련 문제점도 늘어나는 추세”라며 “활용도가 높아진 만큼, AI에 더 큰 권한을 부여할 경우 취약점에 대한 RCE 취약점 악용 공격이 가능해지는 만큼 심각한 보안사고로 이어질 수 있다”고 말했다. 이어 “하나의 에이전트가 수십 개 서비스에 연결되는 환경이 일상화되고 있는데, 편의성이 높아진 만큼 크리덴셜이 유출되면 피해 범위도 커지기 때문에 비인간 신원(NHI: Non-Human Identity)에 대한 보안 관리가 기업 보안의 새로운 과제로 떠오르고 있다”고 말했다. 오픈클로는 최근 공개적으로 보안 자문 풀을 운영하면서 보안성 강화를 진행하고 있으며, 오픈AI와 협업을 시작했다.

(CVE-2026-25253) 2026년 02월 21일 작성자: Moonit 복사됨! 오픈클로(OpenClaw) AI 에이전트에서 링크 하나만 클릭해도 시스템이 장악되는 원격 코드 실행 취약점이 발견됐습니다. CVE-2026-25253 보안 이슈와 클로허브 공급망 공격까지, 지금 당장 확인해야 할 내용을 정리했습니다. 한눈에 보는 블로그 정리 CVE-2026-25253은 CVSS 8.8 고위험 취약점으로, 악성 링크 클릭 한 번으로 시스템 전체가 장악될 수 있습니다. 로컬 환경에서도 예외 없이 공격이 가능하며, 방화벽조차 우회합니다. 클로허브 마켓플레이스에서는 1,184개의 악성 스킬이 추가로 발견돼 이중 위협이 현실화됐습니다. 네이버, 카카오, 당근 등 국내 주요 IT 기업들이 사내 사용을 전면 차단했습니다. 2026.1.29 버전 이상으로 즉시 업데이트하고 토큰과 API 키를 전면 재발급해야 합니다. 목차 Toggle AI 비서가 해커의 문을 열어줬다 취약점 작동 방식, 생각보다 단순해서 더 무섭습니다 클로허브 마켓플레이스, 또 다른 위협의 진원지 국내 대형 IT 기업들은 이미 차단했습니다 관련 뉴스 지금 당장 해야 할 조치 체크리스트 AI 에이전트 시대, 보안 설계 방식이 바뀌어야 합니다 마치며 함께 보면 좋은 글 AI 비서가 해커의 문을 열어줬다 오픈클로는 슬랙, 텔레그램, iMessage 같은 메신저는 물론이고 로컬 파일 시스템까지 직접 제어하는 자율형 AI 에이전트입니다. 전 세계 13만 5천 개 이상의 인스턴스가 실제 업무에 활용되고 있을 만큼 개발자들 사이에서 인기가 높습니다. 그런데 바로 그 넓은 권한이 이번 사태의 핵심 문제였습니다. 보안 연구팀 depthfirst 가 코드를 감사하던 중 취약점을 발견했습니다. 편의성을 위해 설계된 자동 연결 기능이 어느 순간 공격자의 뒷문이 되어 있었던 것입니다. Cisco Talos는 오픈클로를 두고 생산성 측면에서는 획기적이지만 보안 측면에서는 심각한 도전이라고 평가했습니다. 취약점 작동 방식, 생각보다 단순해서 더 무섭습니다 이번 취약점의 핵심은 오픈클로 컨트롤 UI가 URL에 포함된 gatewayUrl 파라미터를 아무런 검증 없이 신뢰한다는 점입니다. 공격자가 만든 링크를 사용자가 클릭하는 순간, 오픈클로는 스스로 공격자 서버로 인증 토큰을 전송합니다. 공격 단계 발생 상황 결과 1단계 악성 링크 클릭 또는 페이지 방문 인증 토큰 공격자 서버로 유출 2단계 크로스사이트 웹소켓 하이재킹(CSWSH) 로컬 방화벽 우회, localhost 직접 접근 3단계 샌드박스 비활성화, 안전장치 해제 API 명령으로 보안 설정 제거 4단계 임의 명령 실행 시스템 전체 장악 완료 더 충격적인 건 로컬 환경도 안전하지 않다 는 사실입니다. 일반적으로 인터넷에서 localhost는 접근이 불가능하지만, 브라우저는 HTTP와 달리 웹소켓 연결에는 동일 출처 정책(SOP)을 적용하지 않습니다. 오픈클로의 웹소켓 서버가 오리진 헤더 검증을 하지 않아, 사용자의 브라우저 자체가 공격의 경유지가 됩니다. 클로허브 마켓플레이스, 또 다른 위협의 진원지 CVE-2026-25253 하나만으로도 충분히 심각한데, 더 큰 문제가 따로 있었습니다. 기능 확장을 위한 스킬 마켓플레이스 클로허브(ClawHub)에서 대규모 공급망 공격이 동시에 진행되고 있었습니다. 조사 기관 감사 규모 악성 스킬 수 Koi Security 2,857개 341개 (ClawHavoc 캠페인) 보안 연구팀 전체 1,184개 (12개 계정 업로드) Snyk 3,984개 283개 (7.1%) 인증정보 노출 Bitdefender 전체 약 900개 (전체 20%) 악성 행위 클로허브는 일주일만 지난 깃허브 계정이면 누구나 스킬을 등록할 수 있었습니다. 공격자 한 명이 무려 677개의 악성 패키지를 혼자 올렸습니다. 1위 스킬조차 9개의 보안 취약점을 숨기고 있었고, 수천 번 다운로드됐습니다. 악성코드는 SSH 키, 브라우저 비밀번호, 암호화폐 지갑 정보를 조용히 빼갔습니다. 국내 대형 IT 기업들은 이미 차단했습니다 국내 보안 업계도 신속하게 반응했습니다. 안랩 ASEC는 이번 취약점이 AI 에이전트의 광범위한 권한을 노린 고도화된 공격이라며 특별 경고를 발령했습니다. KISA 역시 긴급 보안 권고를 통해 즉시 업데이트를 촉구했습니다. 실제 대응도 빠르게 이뤄졌습니다. 연합뉴스 보도에 따르면 네이버, 카카오, 당근 등 국내 주요 IT 기업들이 2월 초 사내망과 업무용 기기에서 오픈클로 사용을 전면 차단했습니다. AI 비서 도구 하나가 내부망 전체를 위험에 빠뜨릴 수 있다는 인식이 기업 보안 담당자들 사이에서 빠르게 확산된 결과입니다. 관련 뉴스 네이버·카카오·당근 등 ‘오픈클로’ 사내 사용 제한 지금 당장 해야 할 조치 체크리스트 오픈클로는 1월 30일 패치 버전을 배포했습니다. 하지만 업데이트 하나로 모든 게 해결되지는 않습니다. 노출 인스턴스 비율이 약 35%에 달한다는 분석도 있어, 이미 탈취됐을 가능성을 전제하고 움직이는 것이 안전합니다. 조치 항목 우선순위 대상 2026.1.29 버전 이상 업데이트 긴급 전체 사용자 게이트웨이 인증 토큰 재발급 긴급 전체 사용자 연결된 서비스 API 키 전면 교체 높음 기업 환경 필수 클로허브 설치 스킬 전수 검토 높음 스킬 사용자 웹소켓 트래픽 이상 로그 점검 권고 기업 보안팀 SSH 키 및 암호화폐 지갑 재확인 권고 개발자, 크립토 사용자 AI 에이전트 시대, 보안 설계 방식이 바뀌어야 합니다 보안 전문가 Simon Willison이 제시한 치명적 삼위일체 라는 개념이 주목받고 있습니다. 개인 데이터 접근 권한, 신뢰할 수 없는 외부 콘텐츠 노출, 외부 통신 기능, 이 세 가지가 동시에 충족되는 순간 AI 에이전트는 정보 유출의 완벽한 통로가 된다는 것입니다. 오픈클로는 세 조건 모두에 해당합니다. AI 에이전트가 수십 개 서비스에 연결되는 환경이 일상이 된 지금, 비인간 신원(NHI) 관리라는 새로운 보안 개념이 기업의 핵심 과제로 떠올랐습니다. 편의성이 높아진 만큼 한 번의 침투가 만드는 피해의 범위도 기하급수적으로 커졌기 때문입니다. 이번 사태가 단순한 취약점 패치로 끝날 문제가 아닌 이유가 바로 여기에 있습니다. 마치며 오픈클로 CVE-2026-25253은 AI 에이전트에 넓은 권한을 부여할수록 보안 위험도 함께 커진다는 사실을 정면으로 보여줬습니다. 지금 사용 중이라면 즉시 업데이트와 토큰 재발급부터 시작하세요. 함께 보면 좋은 글 지브리 ai 이미지를 영상으로 만드는 2가지 방법 AI로 웹툰 그리기 | 나만의 스토리를 4컷으로? 사이버 보안 강화로 주목받는 디도스 관련주 Top3 스마트폰 광고 제거하는 가장 확실한 프라이빗 DNS 설정법 구형 노트북 우분투 설치법, 오픈클로 실행을 위한 첫걸음 댓글 남기기 응답 취소 댓글 이름 다음 번 댓글 작성을 위해 이 브라우저에 이름, 이메일, 그리고 웹사이트를 저장합니다. 상호 : 도리하우스 주소지 : 대구 남구, E-mail : kwojiro486@gmail.com 저작권자 © 도리하우스 © 2026 Moonit • 제작됨 GeneratePress 트렌드 리뷰 모바일 모바일 앱 운영체제 소프트웨어 하드웨어 정보 웹 게임 정보보안 AI 공부 Close 목차 × AI 비서가 해커의 문을 열어줬다 취약점 작동 방식, 생각보다 단순해서 더 무섭습니다 클로허브 마켓플레이스, 또 다른 위협의 진원지 국내 대형 IT 기업들은 이미 차단했습니다 관련 뉴스 지금 당장 해야 할 조치 체크리스트 AI 에이전트 시대, 보안 설계 방식이 바뀌어야 합니다 마치며 함께 보면 좋은 글 → 목차 검색:\",\n  \"truncated\": false,\n  \"content_length\": 3861\n}"}], "structuredContent": {"result": {"ok": true, "url": "https://moonit.kr/openclaw-cve-2026-25253-security-vulnerability/", "final_url": "https://moonit.kr/openclaw-cve-2026-25253-security-vulnerability/", "status_code": 200, "title": "오픈클로 우려했던 보안 문제 현실로?

Cisco Talos는 오픈클로를 두고 생산성 측면에서는 획기적이지만 보안 측면에서는 심각한 도전이라고 평가했습니다. 취약점 작동 방식, 생각보다 단순해서 더 무섭습니다 이번 취약점의 핵심은 오픈클로 컨트롤 UI가 URL에 포함된 gatewayUrl 파라미터를 아무런 검증 없이 신뢰한다는 점입니다. 공격자가 만든 링크를 사용자가 클릭하는 순간, 오픈클로는 스스로 공격자 서버로 인증 토큰을 전송합니다. 공격 단계 발생 상황 결과 1단계 악성 링크 클릭 또는 페이지 방문 인증 토큰 공격자 서버로 유출 2단계 크로스사이트 웹소켓 하이재킹(CSWSH) 로컬 방화벽 우회, localhost 직접 접근 3단계 샌드박스 비활성화, 안전장치 해제 API 명령으로 보안 설정 제거 4단계 임의 명령 실행 시스템 전체 장악 완료 더 충격적인 건 로컬 환경도 안전하지 않다 는 사실입니다. 일반적으로 인터넷에서 localhost는 접근이 불가능하지만, 브라우저는 HTTP와 달리 웹소켓 연결에는 동일 출처 정책(SOP)을 적용하지 않습니다. 오픈클로의 웹소켓 서버가 오리진 헤더 검증을 하지 않아, 사용자의 브라우저 자체가 공격의 경유지가 됩니다. 클로허브 마켓플레이스, 또 다른 위협의 진원지 CVE-2026-25253 하나만으로도 충분히 심각한데, 더 큰 문제가 따로 있었습니다. 기능 확장을 위한 스킬 마켓플레이스 클로허브(ClawHub)에서 대규모 공급망 공격이 동시에 진행되고 있었습니다. 조사 기관 감사 규모 악성 스킬 수 Koi Security 2,857개 341개 (ClawHavoc 캠페인) 보안 연구팀 전체 1,184개 (12개 계정 업로드) Snyk 3,984개 283개 (7.1%) 인증정보 노출 Bitdefender 전체 약 900개 (전체 20%) 악성 행위 클로허브는 일주일만 지난 깃허브 계정이면 누구나 스킬을 등록할 수 있었습니다. 공격자 한 명이 무려 677개의 악성 패키지를 혼자 올렸습니다. 1위 스킬조차 9개의 보안 취약점을 숨기고 있었고, 수천 번 다운로드됐습니다. 악성코드는 SSH 키, 브라우저 비밀번호, 암호화폐 지갑 정보를 조용히 빼갔습니다. 국내 대형 IT 기업들은 이미 차단했습니다 국내 보안 업계도 신속하게 반응했습니다. 안랩 ASEC는 이번 취약점이 AI 에이전트의 광범위한 권한을 노린 고도화된 공격이라며 특별 경고를 발령했습니다. KISA 역시 긴급 보안 권고를 통해 즉시 업데이트를 촉구했습니다. 실제 대응도 빠르게 이뤄졌습니다. 연합뉴스 보도에 따르면 네이버, 카카오, 당근 등 국내 주요 IT 기업들이 2월 초 사내망과 업무용 기기에서 오픈클로 사용을 전면 차단했습니다. AI 비서 도구 하나가 내부망 전체를 위험에 빠뜨릴 수 있다는 인식이 기업 보안 담당자들 사이에서 빠르게 확산된 결과입니다. 관련 뉴스 네이버·카카오·당근 등 ‘오픈클로’ 사내 사용 제한 지금 당장 해야 할 조치 체크리스트 오픈클로는 1월 30일 패치 버전을 배포했습니다. 하지만 업데이트 하나로 모든 게 해결되지는 않습니다. 노출 인스턴스 비율이 약 35%에 달한다는 분석도 있어, 이미 탈취됐을 가능성을 전제하고 움직이는 것이 안전합니다. 조치 항목 우선순위 대상 2026.1.29 버전 이상 업데이트 긴급 전체 사용자 게이트웨이 인증 토큰 재발급 긴급 전체 사용자 연결된 서비스 API 키 전면 교체 높음 기업 환경 필수 클로허브 설치 스킬 전수 검토 높음 스킬 사용자 웹소켓 트래픽 이상 로그 점검 권고 기업 보안팀 SSH 키 및 암호화폐 지갑 재확인 권고 개발자, 크립토 사용자 AI 에이전트 시대, 보안 설계 방식이 바뀌어야 합니다 보안 전문가 Simon Willison이 제시한 치명적 삼위일체 라는 개념이 주목받고 있습니다. 개인 데이터 접근 권한, 신뢰할 수 없는 외부 콘텐츠 노출, 외부 통신 기능, 이 세 가지가 동시에 충족되는 순간 AI 에이전트는 정보 유출의 완벽한 통로가 된다는 것입니다. 오픈클로는 세 조건 모두에 해당합니다. AI 에이전트가 수십 개 서비스에 연결되는 환경이 일상이 된 지금, 비인간 신원(NHI) 관리라는 새로운 보안 개념이 기업의 핵심 과제로 떠올랐습니다. 편의성이 높아진 만큼 한 번의 침투가 만드는 피해의 범위도 기하급수적으로 커졌기 때문입니다. 이번 사태가 단순한 취약점 패치로 끝날 문제가 아닌 이유가 바로 여기에 있습니다. 마치며 오픈클로 CVE-2026-25253은 AI 에이전트에 넓은 권한을 부여할수록 보안 위험도 함께 커진다는 사실을 정면으로 보여줬습니다. 지금 사용 중이라면 즉시 업데이트와 토큰 재발급부터 시작하세요. 함께 보면 좋은 글 지브리 ai 이미지를 영상으로 만드는 2가지 방법 AI로 웹툰 그리기 | 나만의 스토리를 4컷으로? 사이버 보안 강화로 주목받는 디도스 관련주 Top3 스마트폰 광고 제거하는 가장 확실한 프라이빗 DNS 설정법 구형 노트북 우분투 설치법, 오픈클로 실행을 위한 첫걸음 댓글 남기기 응답 취소 댓글 이름 다음 번 댓글 작성을 위해 이 브라우저에 이름, 이메일, 그리고 웹사이트를 저장합니다. 상호 : 도리하우스 주소지 : 대구 남구, E-mail : kwojiro486@gmail.com 저작권자 © 도리하우스 © 2026 Moonit • 제작됨 GeneratePress 트렌드 리뷰 모바일 모바일 앱 운영체제 소프트웨어 하드웨어 정보 웹 게임 정보보안 AI 공부 Close 목차 × AI 비서가 해커의 문을 열어줬다 취약점 작동 방식, 생각보다 단순해서 더 무섭습니다 클로허브 마켓플레이스, 또 다른 위협의 진원지 국내 대형 IT 기업들은 이미 차단했습니다 관련 뉴스 지금 당장 해야 할 조치 체크리스트 AI 에이전트 시대, 보안 설계 방식이 바뀌어야 합니다 마치며 함께 보면 좋은 글 → 목차 검색:", "truncated": false, "content_length": 3861}}, "isError": false}}, "session_seq": 108}

Credit: ozalpvahid / Shutterstock 엔도어랩스(Endor Labs) 연구팀이 ‘AI 에이전트를 위한 소셜 미디어’로 알려진 오픈소스 AI 에이전트 프레임워크 오픈클로(OpenClaw)에서 중·고위험 취약점 6건을 발견했다. 취약점은 엔도어랩스가 AI 기반 정적 애플리케이션 보안 테스트(SAST) 엔진으로 플랫폼을 분석하는 과정에서 확인됐다. 해당 엔진은 에이전틱 AI 소프트웨어 내부에서 데이터가 실제로 어떻게 이동하는지 추적하도록 설계됐다. 이번에 확인된 취약점은 서버사이드 요청 위조(SSRF), 웹훅 인증 누락, 인증 우회, 경로 조작(Path Traversal) 등 여러 웹 보안 범주에 걸쳐 있다. LLM과 도구 실행, 외부 연동을 결합한 복합적인 에이전트형 시스템 전반에 영향을 미친다. 연구팀은 각 취약점에 대해 실제 동작하는 개념증명(PoC) 익스플로잇도 공개해 현실 환경에서 악용 가능성을 입증했다. 오픈클로 측은 해당 문제에 대한 패치와 보안 권고문을 발표했다. SSRF 경로·인증 우회·파일 경로 이탈 포함 엔도어랩스는 CVE 식별자 대신 취약점 유형과 개별 심각도 기준으로 오픈클로 취약점 6건을 분류해 공개했다. 여러 취약점은 서로 다른 도구에서 발생한 SSRF 문제다. 이 가운데 하나는 사용자 입력 URL을 받아 외부 웹소켓(WebSocket) 연결을 설정하는 게이트웨이 컴포넌트로, CVSS 점수 7.6을 받았다. 또 다른 SSRF는 ‘어빗 인증(Urbit Authentication)’(CVSS 6.5)과 이미지 도구(Image Tool, CVSS 7.6)에서 확인됐다. 배포 환경에 따라 내부 서비스나 클라우드 메타데이터 엔드포인트에 접근할 수 있어 중~고위험으로 평가됐다. 접근 통제 실패도 주요 문제로 지적됐다. 외부 이벤트를 수신하는 웹훅 핸들러 ‘텔닉스(Telnyx)’는 웹훅 검증 절차가 미흡해, 신뢰할 수 없는 출처에서 위조 요청을 보낼 수 있었다(CVSS 7.5). 별도로 확인된 인증 우회 취약점(CVSS 6.5)에서는 인증을 거치지 않은 사용자가 보호된 웹훅 기능 ‘트윌리오(Twilio)’를 유효한 자격 증명 없이 호출할 수 있었다. 공개 내용에는 브라우저 업로드 처리 과정에서 발생하는 경로 조작 취약점도 포함됐다. 파일 경로에 대한 정제 처리가 충분하지 않아, 의도한 디렉토리를 벗어난 위치에 파일을 기록할 수 있는 문제다. 해당 항목에는 CVSS 점수가 부여되지 않았다. 연구팀은 “AI 기반 분석과 체계적인 수동 검증을 결합하면 AI 인프라를 보호할 수 있는 현실적인 해법이 된다”라며 “기업 환경에서 AI 에이전트 프레임워크 도입이 확대되는 만큼, 기존 취약점뿐 아니라 AI 특화 공격 표면까지 함께 다루는 방향으로 보안 분석이 발전해야 한다”라고 밝혔다. 데이터 흐름 추적으로 드러난 위험 엔도어랩스는 기존의 ‘전통적 정적 분석’ 도구가 최신 소프트웨어 스택에서 한계를 보인다고 지적했다. 입력값이 여러 단계를 거쳐 변환된 뒤 위험한 연산에 도달하는 구조에서는 맥락을 유지하기 어렵다는 설명이다. 이를 보완하기 위해 데이터 변환 전반에서 문맥을 유지하는 AI 기반 SAST 방식을 적용했다고 밝혔다. 이 접근 방식은 “위험한 연산이 어디에 있는지뿐 아니라 공격자가 제어할 수 있는 데이터가 실제로 해당 지점까지 도달하는지”까지 파악하는 데 도움을 줬다고 연구팀은 설명했다. 테스트 엔진은 HTTP 파라미터, 설정값, 외부 API 응답 등 다양한 진입 지점에서 시작한 ‘신뢰할 수 없는 데이터’가 네트워크 요청, 파일 작업, 명령 실행과 같은 보안 민감 지점까지 이동하는 전체 경로를 매핑했다. 엔도어랩스는 해당 취약점을 오픈클로 유지관리자에게 책임 공개 방식으로 전달했다고 밝혔다. 이후 오픈클로 측이 문제를 수정하면서 연구팀은 기술 세부 내용을 공개했다. 이번 공개에는 구체적인 완화 가이드는 포함되지 않았지만, 영향받은 구성 요소 전반에 걸쳐 수정이 이뤄졌다고 설명했다. dl-itworldkorea@foundryco.com 인공지능 보안 관련 콘텐츠 뉴스 마이크로소프트 엣지, 비밀번호 관리자 ‘마스터 비밀번호’ 단계적 폐지 By Kristian Kask 2026.02.24 2분 브라우저 보안 엔드포인트 보호 비밀번호 관리자 뉴스 페이팔, 로그인 MFA에서 SMS 단계적 폐지 착수 By Evan Schuman 2026.02.24 5분 액세스 제어 인증 Multifactor Authentication 뉴스 마이크로소프트 365 MFA 우회 노린 신규 피싱 공격 확산 By Howard Solomon 2026.02.23 5분 사이버 범죄 피싱 소셜 엔지니어링 오피니언 생성형 AI 위험을 보호하는 새로운 접근법 By Gregory S.

Credit: ozalpvahid / Shutterstock 엔도어랩스(Endor Labs) 연구팀이 ‘AI 에이전트를 위한 소셜 미디어’로 알려진 오픈소스 AI 에이전트 프레임워크 오픈클로(OpenClaw)에서 중·고위험 취약점 6건을 발견했다. 취약점은 엔도어랩스가 AI 기반 정적 애플리케이션 보안 테스트(SAST) 엔진으로 플랫폼을 분석하는 과정에서 확인됐다. 해당 엔진은 에이전틱 AI 소프트웨어 내부에서 데이터가 실제로 어떻게 이동하는지 추적하도록 설계됐다. 이번에 확인된 취약점은 서버사이드 요청 위조(SSRF), 웹훅 인증 누락, 인증 우회, 경로 조작(Path Traversal) 등 여러 웹 보안 범주에 걸쳐 있다. LLM과 도구 실행, 외부 연동을 결합한 복합적인 에이전트형 시스템 전반에 영향을 미친다. 연구팀은 각 취약점에 대해 실제 동작하는 개념증명(PoC) 익스플로잇도 공개해 현실 환경에서 악용 가능성을 입증했다. 오픈클로 측은 해당 문제에 대한 패치와 보안 권고문을 발표했다. SSRF 경로·인증 우회·파일 경로 이탈 포함 엔도어랩스는 CVE 식별자 대신 취약점 유형과 개별 심각도 기준으로 오픈클로 취약점 6건을 분류해 공개했다. 여러 취약점은 서로 다른 도구에서 발생한 SSRF 문제다. 이 가운데 하나는 사용자 입력 URL을 받아 외부 웹소켓(WebSocket) 연결을 설정하는 게이트웨이 컴포넌트로, CVSS 점수 7.6을 받았다. 또 다른 SSRF는 ‘어빗 인증(Urbit Authentication)’(CVSS 6.5)과 이미지 도구(Image Tool, CVSS 7.6)에서 확인됐다. 배포 환경에 따라 내부 서비스나 클라우드 메타데이터 엔드포인트에 접근할 수 있어 중~고위험으로 평가됐다. 접근 통제 실패도 주요 문제로 지적됐다. 외부 이벤트를 수신하는 웹훅 핸들러 ‘텔닉스(Telnyx)’는 웹훅 검증 절차가 미흡해, 신뢰할 수 없는 출처에서 위조 요청을 보낼 수 있었다(CVSS 7.5). 별도로 확인된 인증 우회 취약점(CVSS 6.5)에서는 인증을 거치지 않은 사용자가 보호된 웹훅 기능 ‘트윌리오(Twilio)’를 유효한 자격 증명 없이 호출할 수 있었다. 공개 내용에는 브라우저 업로드 처리 과정에서 발생하는 경로 조작 취약점도 포함됐다. 파일 경로에 대한 정제 처리가 충분하지 않아, 의도한 디렉토리를 벗어난 위치에 파일을 기록할 수 있는 문제다. 해당 항목에는 CVSS 점수가 부여되지 않았다. 연구팀은 “AI 기반 분석과 체계적인 수동 검증을 결합하면 AI 인프라를 보호할 수 있는 현실적인 해법이 된다”라며 “기업 환경에서 AI 에이전트 프레임워크 도입이 확대되는 만큼, 기존 취약점뿐 아니라 AI 특화 공격 표면까지 함께 다루는 방향으로 보안 분석이 발전해야 한다”라고 밝혔다. 데이터 흐름 추적으로 드러난 위험 엔도어랩스는 기존의 ‘전통적 정적 분석’ 도구가 최신 소프트웨어 스택에서 한계를 보인다고 지적했다. 입력값이 여러 단계를 거쳐 변환된 뒤 위험한 연산에 도달하는 구조에서는 맥락을 유지하기 어렵다는 설명이다. 이를 보완하기 위해 데이터 변환 전반에서 문맥을 유지하는 AI 기반 SAST 방식을 적용했다고 밝혔다. 이 접근 방식은 “위험한 연산이 어디에 있는지뿐 아니라 공격자가 제어할 수 있는 데이터가 실제로 해당 지점까지 도달하는지”까지 파악하는 데 도움을 줬다고 연구팀은 설명했다. 테스트 엔진은 HTTP 파라미터, 설정값, 외부 API 응답 등 다양한 진입 지점에서 시작한 ‘신뢰할 수 없는 데이터’가 네트워크 요청, 파일 작업, 명령 실행과 같은 보안 민감 지점까지 이동하는 전체 경로를 매핑했다. 엔도어랩스는 해당 취약점을 오픈클로 유지관리자에게 책임 공개 방식으로 전달했다고 밝혔다. 이후 오픈클로 측이 문제를 수정하면서 연구팀은 기술 세부 내용을 공개했다. 이번 공개에는 구체적인 완화 가이드는 포함되지 않았지만, 영향받은 구성 요소 전반에 걸쳐 수정이 이뤄졌다고 설명했다. dl-itworldkorea@foundryco.com 인공지능 보안 관련 콘텐츠 뉴스 마이크로소프트 엣지, 비밀번호 관리자 ‘마스터 비밀번호’ 단계적 폐지 By Kristian Kask 2026.02.24 2분 브라우저 보안 엔드포인트 보호 비밀번호 관리자 뉴스 페이팔, 로그인 MFA에서 SMS 단계적 폐지 착수 By Evan Schuman 2026.02.24 5분 액세스 제어 인증 Multifactor Authentication 뉴스 마이크로소프트 365 MFA 우회 노린 신규 피싱 공격 확산 By Howard Solomon 2026.02.23 5분 사이버 범죄 피싱 소셜 엔지니어링 오피니언 생성형 AI 위험을 보호하는 새로운 접근법 By Gregory S.
