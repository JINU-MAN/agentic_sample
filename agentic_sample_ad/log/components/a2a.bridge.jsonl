I will indicate that no papers were found and that the WebSearchAnalyst should search the web for information about BERT.\n\nAdditional Needs:\n- [WebSearchAnalyst] Find trustworthy web sources and recent reports for BERT.\n\n[Step 2 - WebSearchAnalyst]\nOkay, I will search for trustworthy web sources and recent reports for BERT.\nThe search results are a bit noisy, with results for \"Bert\" Ogden Auto Group, the video game Q*bert, and the Sesame Street character Bert. I will filter these out and focus on the results related to the BERT language model.\n\nThe following sources appear most relevant:\n*   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)) - Wikipedia article on BERT\n*   [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nlp/explanation-of-bert-model-nlp/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nlp/explanation-of-bert-model-nlp/) - GeeksforGeeks explanation of BERT\n*   [https://www.snowflake.com/en/fundamentals/bert/](https://www.snowflake.com/en/fundamentals/bert/) - Snowflake's explanation of BERT\n\nI will fetch the Wikipedia page to get a good overview.\nI have fetched the Wikipedia article on BERT. It provides a good overview of BERT, including its architecture, training, and history.\nI have also fetched the GeeksforGeeks article. It explains the architecture, working, and applications of BERT, with a focus on the Masked Language Model (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) training strategies.\n\nHere's a summary of the findings:\n\n*   **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** is a language model introduced by Google in 2018. (Wikipedia, GeeksforGeeks, Snowflake)\n*   It uses a transformer-based neural network to understand and generate human-like language. (GeeksforGeeks)\n*   BERT employs an encoder-only architecture. (Wikipedia, GeeksforGeeks)\n*   BERT is pre-trained on large amounts of unlabeled text data to learn contextual embeddings. (GeeksforGeeks)\n*   Key training strategies include Masked Language Model (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP). (GeeksforGeeks)\n*   BERT has two model sizes: BASE (110 million parameters) and LARGE (340 million parameters). (Wikipedia)\n\nAdditional Needs: none\n\n[Step 3 - WebSearchAnalyst]\nOkay, I will post the summary and link of the Wikipedia page to the \"agentic\" channel in Slack.\nThe message has been posted to the \"agentic\" channel in Slack.\n\nAdditional Needs: none\n\n[Step 4 - WebSearchAnalyst]\nOkay, the previous steps identified some initial web sources, but the focus now is to find more trustworthy and in-depth explanations of BERT, ideally academic papers. I will use `search_web_candidates_with_mcp` to search for these.\nThe search results are not very relevant. It seems like focusing on \"BERT\" is bringing in too much noise from other uses of the word. I will try a more specific search focusing on transformer architecture and language models in the context of Google.\nStill getting a lot of general results. It seems a direct search for \"academic paper\" is not effective. I will try searching for specific components of BERT architecture, combined with \"paper\".\nThese results are still not ideal.

The US State Department fielded hundreds of calls from stranded travelers.\n*   **Security Concerns**: Security experts suggest the violence could continue for days or weeks.

This has spurred retaliatory violence, leading to school cancellations and warnings for citizens to stay inside.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n*   CNN (mentions stranded tourists due to violence): (https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/mexico-el-mencho-killed-travel-chaos-02-23-26-intl-hnk)\n*   AP News (reports on security forces fighting cartel gunmen): (https://apnews.com/article/mexico-jalisco-cartel-mencho-sheinbaum-trump-226e50edc33f981d5d6509acc7021ae5)\n*   Reuters (provides general Mexico news): (https://www.reuters.com/world/mexico/)\n*   New York Times (reports on violence ebbing but Mexico remaining on edge): (https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/02/23/world/mexico-cartel-el-mencho)\n*   CBS News (reports on the killing of \"El Mencho\"): (https://www.cbsnews.com/news/violence-mexico-jalisco-new-generation-cartel-killed-military-puerto-vallarta/)\n*   PBS NewsHour (reports on fears of more violence): (https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/many-in-mexico-fear-more-violence-after-army-kills-cartel-leader-el-mencho)\n*   USA Today (reports on unrest and security risks): (https://www.usatoday.com/live-story/news/world/2026/02/23/mexico-el-mencho-live-updates-news/88821399007/)\n\nIt's important to note that some of the dates in the search results are showing as February 2026, which is likely an error in the search indexing or reporting.

(https://www.aljazeera.com/where/mexico/)\\n*   **Reuters:** The page could not be accessed due to a 401 error.\\n*   **BBC:** The page could not be accessed due to a 404 error.\\n\\nIt appears that recent events include clashes between the military and cartels, as well as violence following the killing of a drug lord. There are also reports of political developments involving President Claudia Sheinbaum. It seems some of the information is outdated, referencing events from February 2026, which is in the future.\\n\\nSince some of the information appears to be future dated, I'll perform another search, this time narrowing the queries to the past week to get more accurate, up-to-date information.\\nThe search results from the past week seem to be dominated by \\\"Daz 3D,\\\" which is irrelevant. I need to refine my search strategy. It's possible that using \\\"last week\\\" is too restrictive and returning irrelevant results. I will try searching for \\\"Mexico current events June 2024\\\" to see if I can get more targeted results.\\nIt seems like my search terms are consistently returning irrelevant results. I will try more generic terms and check more results per query.\\nOkay, this search provides more relevant results, although some are still outdated (February 2026). The main events seem to be related to violence following the killing of a cartel leader named \\\"El Mencho.\\\"\\n\\nBased on the search results, here is a summary of the current situation in Mexico:\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n\\nRecent reports indicate heightened security concerns and violence in several Mexican states following the killing of a powerful cartel leader, \\\"El Mencho.\\\" The Mexican military was involved in the operation that led to his death. This has spurred retaliatory violence, leading to school cancellations and warnings for citizens to stay inside.\\n\\n**Sources:**\\n\\n*   CNN (mentions stranded tourists due to violence): (https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/mexico-el-mencho-killed-travel-chaos-02-23-26-intl-hnk)\\n*   AP News (reports on security forces fighting cartel gunmen): (https://apnews.com/article/mexico-jalisco-cartel-mencho-sheinbaum-trump-226e50edc33f981d5d6509acc7021ae5)\\n*   Reuters (provides general Mexico news): (https://www.reuters.com/world/mexico/)\\n*   New York Times (reports on violence ebbing but Mexico remaining on edge): (https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/02/23/world/mexico-cartel-el-mencho)\\n*   CBS News (reports on the killing of \\\"El Mencho\\\"): (https://www.cbsnews.com/news/violence-mexico-jalisco-new-generation-cartel-killed-military-puerto-vallarta/)\\n*   PBS NewsHour (reports on fears of more violence): (https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/many-in-mexico-fear-more-violence-after-army-kills-cartel-leader-el-mencho)\\n*   USA Today (reports on unrest and security risks): (https://www.usatoday.com/live-story/news/world/2026/02/23/mexico-el-mencho-live-updates-news/88821399007/)\\n\\nIt's important to note that some of the dates in the search results are showing as February 2026, which is likely an error in the search indexing or reporting.

Here's my plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Query Candidates:** I'll generate several search queries targeting news articles about Samsung stock price changes in the past two weeks.\n2.  **Search the Web:** I'll use the `search_web_candidates_with_mcp` tool to search the web using my query candidates.\n3.  **Evaluate Relevance:** I'll examine the search results to identify articles that specifically discuss Samsung's stock price fluctuations within the specified timeframe.\n4.  **Fetch Relevant Pages:** I'll use `fetch_web_page_with_mcp` to fetch the content of the most relevant articles.\n5.  **Summarize Findings:** I will pass the URLs of the relevant articles to the next step to be summarized.\n\nHere are my query candidates:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"queries_json\": \"[\\\"Samsung stock price last 2 weeks\\\", \\\"Samsung Electronics stock fluctuation recent\\\", \\\"Samsung share price news\\\", \\\"Samsung stock market performance last two weeks\\\", \\\"삼성전자 주가 최근 2주\\\", \\\"Samsung stock analysis recent\\\"]\"\n}\n```\nThe search results are not very relevant.

It seems the search engine is misinterpreting the queries, possibly due to the way the queries are structured. I will try structuring the queries differently and including the word \"stock price\" to make the intent clearer.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"queries_json\": \"[\\\"Samsung Electronics stock price news in Korea\\\", \\\"News about Samsung stock price\\\", \\\"Recent Samsung stock price news\\\"]\"\n}\n```\nStill getting irrelevant results.

The search results are not providing relevant information. Since the original request was for news articles *and* brokerage reports, I will focus my queries on brokerage reports specifically. I will also try a broader search without the specific month.\\n\\nHere are my new query candidates:\\n1. \\\"Samsung Electronics stock report 2026 South Korea\\\"\\n2. \\\"삼성전자 증권 리포트 2026 대한민국\\\"\\n3. \\\"Samsung stock analysis 2026 South Korea\\\"\\n4. \\\"삼성 주식 분석 2026 대한민국\\\"\\nThe search results continue to be dominated by irrelevant links to the Samsung community and general Samsung pages. It is possible that there is limited information available online about Samsung Electronics stock specifically for February 2026, as it is still in the future.

I'm going to try one more time, but this time I will add the current date to the query to see if that helps.\\n\\nHere are my final query candidates:\\n1. \\\"Samsung Electronics news release January 26 2026\\\"\\n2. \\\"Samsung press release January 26 2026\\\"\\nThe search results are consistently returning irrelevant information, primarily from the Samsung Community and with incorrect dates. It seems the search tool is not functioning as expected. I cannot reliably find a relevant news article about Samsung Electronics with the current tool.\\n\\nAdditional Needs:\\n- [MainAgent] Please investigate the search tool's functionality and determine why it is returning irrelevant results with incorrect dates.\\n\\n[Step 3 - MainAgent]\\nOkay, based on the context, the `WebSearchAnalyst` has repeatedly failed to find relevant news about Samsung due to irrelevant results and incorrect dates in the search results. The user's latest request is to find just one recent news article.\\n\\nSince the search tool seems to be malfunctioning, I need to confirm this before proceeding. I'll try to use the tool directly with a very simple query and check the result. If it still returns garbage, I'll report the problem.\\n\\nI will try searching for \\\"today news\\\" to see if the tool returns relevant results with correct dates.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"needs\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"target\\\": \\\"WebSearchAnalyst\\\",\\n      \\\"request\\\": \\\"Search for 'today news' and summarize the first result.\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\",\n    \"open_needs\": [\n      \"[WebSearchAnalyst] Search for 'today news' and summarize the first result.\"\n    ],\n    \"remaining_steps\": [\n      {\n        \"agent\": \"MainAgent\",\n        \"goal\": \"Report search tool status based on the WebSearchAnalyst's output.\",\n        \"tool_hints\": []\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"agent_catalog\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"MainAgent\",\n      \"role\": \"coordinator\",\n      \"type\": \"local\",\n      \"is_current\": false,\n      \"description\": \"Coordinator for planning, replanning, and cross-agent handoff execution.\",\n      \"capabilities\": [\n        \"coordination\",\n        \"workflow_replanning\",\n        \"user_clarification_routing\",\n        \"comm.slack.post\",\n        \"mainagent\",\n        \"slack_post_message\"\n      ],\n      \"tools\": [\n        \"slack_post_message\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"PaperAnalyst\",\n      \"role\": \"worker\",\n      \"type\": \"a2a\",\n      \"is_current\": false,\n      \"description\": \"Paper search, full-text memory expansion, and follow-up Q&A from local PDF corpus.\",\n      \"capabilities\": [\n        \"paper_search\",\n        \"paper_summary\",\n        \"paper_fulltext_memory\",\n        \"paper_memory_query\",\n        \"paperanalyst\",\n        \"scrape_papers_with_mcp\",\n        \"load_paper_memory_with_mcp\",\n        \"expand_paper_memory_with_mcp\",\n        \"query_paper_memory\"\n      ],\n      \"tools\": [\n        \"scrape_papers_with_mcp\",\n        \"load_paper_memory_with_mcp\",\n        \"expand_paper_memory_with_mcp\",\n        \"query_paper_memory\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"SocialMediaAnalyst\",\n      \"role\": \"worker\",\n      \"type\": \"a2a\",\n      \"is_current\": false,\n      \"description\": \"SNS post collection, relevance filtering, and concise social signal summarization.\",\n      \"capabilities\": [\n        \"sns_search\",\n        \"sns_summary\",\n        \"socialmediaanalyst\",\n        \"scrape_sns...(truncated)"}, "session_seq": 7589}

SNS 및 커뮤니티 시그널 분석\n*   **공식적인 논의 부재:** X(Twitter) 및 Reddit 내 'OpenClaw security' 또는 'CVE-2026-25253' 키워드에 대한 유기적인 포스팅이 발견되지 않았습니다.\n*   **원인 추정:** \n    *   **신규 취약점 또는 미래 시나리오:** 보고된 CVE-2026-25253의 연도 표기(2026)와 기업들의 차단 시점(2026년 2월)으로 미루어 볼 때, 이는 매우 최근에 발표된 제로데이 공격이거나 특정 보안 시뮬레이션 시나리오일 가능성이 높습니다.\n    *   **내부 보안 중심 논의:** 일반 대중보다는 기업 보안팀(CISO)이나 인프라 운영팀 내부 채널(Private Slack, 폐쇄형 포럼 등)을 중심으로 긴급 조치가 이루어지고 있어 공용 SNS로의 확산이 지연되고 있는 것으로 보입니다.\n\n#### 2. 예상되는 커뮤니티 반응 및 잠재적 리스크\n*   **개발자 신뢰도 급락:** 1,000개 이상의 악성 스킬이 유통된 '클로허브(ClawHub)' 공급망 공격의 규모로 인해, 오픈소스 AI 에이전트 마켓플레이스 전반에 대한 불신이 확산될 것으로 예상됩니다.\n*   **기업용 AI 비서 도입 위축:** 네이버, 카카오 등 국내 빅테크 기업들의 선제적 차단 조치가 알려지면서, 다른 기업들도 유사한 '에이전트 차단(Agent-Ban)' 정책을 검토할 가능성이 큽니다.\n*   **Shadow AI 리스크:** 공식적인 차단 조치에도 불구하고 개인적으로 오픈클로를 사용하는 개발자들에 대한 내부 감사 및 보안 교육 강화 필요성이 제기될 것입니다.\n\n#### 3. 소셜 미디어 모니터링 결론\n현재 오픈클로 관련 보안 이슈는 **공식적인 뉴스 보도와 기업의 선제적 대응 단계**에 머물러 있으며, 일반 사용자의 SNS 바이럴 단계로는 진입하지 않은 상태입니다. 보안 담당자는 SNS의 반응보다는 앞서 보고된 **공식 가이드(2026.1.29 버전 업데이트 및 API 키 재발급)**에 따라 즉각적인 기술적 조치를 취할 것을 권고합니다.\n\n---\n**Additional Needs:**\n- [MainAgent] 위 SNS 분석 결과와 이전 단계의 뉴스 요약본을 통합하여 슬랙 'agentic' 채널에 최종 보안 리포트 형식으로 게시해 주세요.
